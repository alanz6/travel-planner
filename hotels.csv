1,1,W Times Square,235238.0,"This is probably the worst W anywhere! If you are considering it, find an alternative! There are plenty of far better options. The hotel is not worthy of the W name.  Room was super basic, not even a coffee maker, no chic vibe, no nice decor.. a basic, bland, boring room - should not be a W! The $30 rip off “destination fee” is a joke. You are forced to pay $30, covering wifi that is free with status, then to use your $30 “credit” it is almost $60 for 2 drinks at the outdated, no view, bar! Marriott should be ashamed of themselves for this NY policy. As a “loyal” elite, in NY I would seriously consider booking a different brand. To top off the poor experience, on check out, another bar charge was added to my bill… over $200 tab, that was not ours. I advised front desk, who said nothing they can do except tell F+B manager, I gave them the benefit of doubt and said ok. Next day, I was still at hotel as my partner had a separate res, and I asked again, charge was still on my folio. I asked 3 times, and charge was never investigated. A week later my CC had been charged for the error… Now it is being “investigated” by Bonvoy. This hotel is a joke, they do not deserve the W name, or anyones business. Book elsewhere… AC by Marriott and Renaissance are far superior….",1,2024-11-09T14:44:12Z
2,1,W Times Square,235238.0,"Every year that I've been to Manhattan, I'll stay some other properties, including The Westin.

This time, I had the privilege to stay in W New York, and I've heard good things about the infamous bar.

We had a room facing Marriott Marquis, and on a daily basis, given that I'm a Marriott Bonvoy member, we get complimentary gifts. The New York destination fee also allows us to redeem complimentary drinks at W Bar.

I expected more rowdy music but great indie music and nice sofas, complimented by great service.

Shout out to a lovely and fun-loving concierge team. Keep up the first moment of service truth.",4,2024-11-03T00:34:32Z
3,1,W Times Square,235238.0,"We stayed at the W hotel for two nights and had a great experience. Eric helped us with our luggage as we walked up to the hotel. He put them on a luggage cart and stayed with us through the check in process until we got to our room. Check in was painless and the front desk employee who checked us in was so friendly and helpful. Eric brought our luggage to our room, gave us a quick tour of the room, and even asked if the temperature of the room was okay. Very impressive!! 

A few standout things: We called and asked for more pillows and an employee brought them with gloves on! So impressive. We requested a fan (we sleep with a fan at home and are so used to the noise and air flow) and they brought us a large tower fan. My husband cut his foot and we asked for antibiotic ointment and they provided it without hesitation.

We stayed in what I believe was called the Wow Suite. The room was impressive- very large. One thing that could be improved is that prices of the mini bar and snack bar that are in the room should be provided. There was a sticker on some items with a number on them, but we ended up being charged $13 for a can of Pringles (lololol). We laughed about it because we obviously knew that it would be more expensive than usual, but I wish the prices were disclosed. The shower in the room was small and there was no bathtub. There was a questionable stain on the older couch in the sitting room area. 

Overall our stay was comfortable and we were very impressed with the service provided. We hope to return someday soon!",4,2024-10-13T21:27:25Z
4,1,W Times Square,235238.0,"Fantastic Location!! Sally checked us in and she was very friendly, and greeted us with such a warm smile, and it just set the tone for us to enjoy our stay. Sally also informed us with all the benefits for being a Bonvoy preferred member which I was able to take advantage of them. From start to finish it was wonderful, and my reason of coming back and staying for my next trip in November. If I could I would give Sally a 100 stars!!!!",5,2024-10-08T15:01:12Z
5,1,W Times Square,235238.0,"Stayed here for an anniversary break and could not have chosen better.
The staff are amazing, so helpful and friendly.
The room was amazing with a dual aspect view of Times Square one way and The Hudson river the other - fascinating to watch New York all those floors below.
Jesse on reception and Nuk, front of house, went out of their way to make our stay extra special- thank you. 
Highly recommended",5,2024-10-08T11:28:47Z
6,2,W Los Angeles West Beverly Hills,77700.0,We had an excellent stay at this hotel.   Everyone working at the hotel was friendly and helpful.  I especially appreciated the help I received from Joe at check-in.  The pool area was a nice place to relax.  Great location near UCLA and Westwood.,5,2024-11-03T17:29:02Z
7,2,W Los Angeles West Beverly Hills,77700.0,"This hotel has it all-amazing location, staff, and service.The check in process was smooth. Our room was spacious and immaculate.

8,2,W Los Angeles West Beverly Hills,77700.0,"We added this as night of our trip because we are high level Bonvoy and have enjoyed exceptional service at the W in South Beach. There is nothing similar between the properties. There are no upgrades nor recognition here, not even thanks for being  a member. The decor is fresh given the age of the facility. The food and drinks are well priced at Happy Hour but at that time, the portions are very small. I would only stay here again if I needed to be near UCLA for some reason.  The pool is nice but there is no service. You help yourself at the restaurant nearby.",4,2024-10-17T19:01:54Z
9,2,W Los Angeles West Beverly Hills,77700.0,"Traveled here as I could not go home to Tampa due to the hurricane. 

Had an amazing check in experience with Mason. Also had a great happy hour dinner at STK.  Jasmine and Dom were great bartenders! I know STK is a separate company but just wanted to mention them so if you read this you go check it out separately from the hotel.

However, that is where the positive experience ended. I go back to my room after dinner to get ready for bed and find that the room had not cooled down from when I checked in and there was barely any air coming in when I had the AC turned up. I called down and they sent engineering up right away. He was super friendly and said he would try to fix it. He did some things to it and then went back downstairs. I then receive a call telling me that the HVAC is broken in my room and I can either open my windows or move rooms. I elected to move rooms since it was very warm as the high was in the 80s today. I was unpacked and in a robe ready for bed so was really not happy that I had to pack back up after flying here today and was about to sleep. 
They told me to call down when I was ready for the key. I call back down and they place me on hold and tell me they got me a room on the same floor so I wouldn’t have to go far. I asked if there was anything they could do for the inconvenience. They tell me they can give me a $50 food and beverage credit. I asked politely if there is more that they can do as $50 basically buys you one or two drinks in LA and I didn’t feel that was enough. They said they can do $100 and that was more than generous that I am staying on an explore friends rate. I let them know I work in hotel management and I really don’t think that is a fair reason to not treat me like any other guest. They told me “you should be more understanding if you work in hotels”. They then said the room they would give me is an upgraded room on a corner as well. I said okay thanks and they bring the key. I go to the new room to discover that it’s not an upgraded room, but it’s a handicapped room (not as nice as the original before). At this point I am very annoyed and I call back down as I was not given what I was told. 

The employee picks up on speaker phone and I can hear one of their employees in the background speaking badly about me. Now I am ANGRY.  I let them know that I could hear what was just said about me and that I was not given an upgraded room on a corner but a handicapped room. They told me that I said I wanted to be on the same floor (which I never said). I told them I never said that I cared what floor I was on. They are the ones who told me they would get me a room on the same floor and I was pleased with that. They also said “if you work for Marriott you should know you’re a reflection of the person who filled out the form and you should not be combative about the room.” I also do not work for Marriott and never said I did. I explained to them that no matter who I am, what rate I am staying at, and regardless of working in hospitality or not that I would never tell a guest how they should act or to be more understanding. That is completely unacceptable. I let them know the way that they are handling the situation and speaking to & about me was horrible. I let them know I want the upgraded room that I was promised on the phone. They then say they will send up a key for the corner room on the floor above. I then wait about 15 minutes for someone to come up with the new key. Finally I get the new key and at no point in being delivered the new keys from Lin did I receive an in person apology for this customer service. 
I am now finally in a nice corner room with AC. 
I have never in my life had such a horrible hotel customer service experience and I travel frequently & all over the world.",1,2024-10-12T00:35:04Z
10,2,W Los Angeles West Beverly Hills,77700.0,Lovely hotel conveniently located within walking distance of Westwood and other destinations. Beautiful rooms and a very helpful staff.

11,3,Shangri-La Jakarta,302122.0,"Yosephine (Jose) has been helping us from the very beginning for our sangjit ceremony. She is always on top of everything, making sure the preparation, menu suggestion, and technical meeting goes smoothly. In addition, even when she was on day off, she made sure that Inez was up to date with what was going on to make sure everything is perfect. All in all, we are extremely happy with Yosephine’s service and would recommend her to everyone for all banquet / events need.

Pak Sandy Banquet Supervisor and his staff: Awa, Arman, Sharon
Sandy’s attention to detail is excellent. He swiftly organized everything according to plan and the teamwork among all staff was wonderful in making sure nothing left behind. The staff are also paramount in providing quality service, such as refilling beverages, and used plates and glasses were quickly picked up. Also, the team helped in arranging a beautiful and elegant center piece decoration for the event. We are happy with the service provided.

Shout out to Chef Fauzie. Food is wonderful, our guests mentioned that the taste is excellent. We mentioned at food tasting day that we preferred less salty food, and the chef has delivered very well. Food presentation was also wonderful according to our VIP guests. 

Dita GRO staff is very easy to work with. She would ask our preference for the special amenity arrangement for our hotel room. As we first entered the room, we were very excited to see how beautiful the flower bouquet and the cake too. Thank you very much for your hard work.

We were planning to have the wedding at the Shangri-la hotel a week after our sangjit day. However, the date that we picked was not available. So, we are hoping to have another wedding event at the hotel later in the future for my brother. Yosephine’s service as a wedding salesperson is beyond expectation and even the organizer and MC complimented how attentive she was. We are delighted to be served by Yosephine and thank you for making my sangjit event so memorable.",5,2024-11-13T11:26:06Z

16,4,Mina A'Salam Madinat Jumeirah,302465.0,"We stayed in July 2024, on a layover from Australia to the UK. We were so impressed by the colleagues and the service we received. From the moment of stepping out of the taxi, to the very early check-in, each of the restaurants, the colleagues manning the club car station, the beach & pool attendants, absolutely everyone was friendly, smiley, courteous, interested and engaged.

The colleagues paid such kind attention to my daughter, making her feel so special, that she told me she wanted to move to Dubai and live in the hotel. I may need to work harder to make that a reality. 

Specific shout outs to the colleague that checked us in (so well-presented, very professional), the laundry team for working so hard and so quickly to remove the vomit (due to motion sickness) from our various clothes, bags and soft toys; the Malaysian manager at Zheng He’s restaurant for her warmth, care, humour, knowledge and guidance; the housekeeping colleagues for their energetic greetings and attentive cleaning of our room, and finally Tatyana the brilliant Kazakh guest relations employee who went above and beyond in her care and recognition of my daughter. 

In addition to the fantastic service, the room was beautifully decorated, brilliantly presented, and provided a cool and calm oasis for us. We slept so well, and sunrise coffee overlooking the beach and Burj Al Arab was a great way to start each day. The new pool down on the beach is brilliant, and the pool service was top class. 

We loved our stay, would highly recommend the hotel, and are excited about our return in the future. Thank you to everyone at Mina Al Salam for a special, memorable stay.",5,2024-10-31T19:04:36Z
17,4,Mina A'Salam Madinat Jumeirah,302465.0,"Our stay at this hotel will leave us a lot of beautiful memories, with a couple of bad experiences, that were mainly not provoked by the hotel facilities or by the personnel of the hotel. Instead, almost everyone tried to ease the negative circumstances and make our stay mostly enjoyable. The location is amazing and you can take for free all day long the abras and buggies to visit the other resorts part of the Jumeirah group and this was very favourable in our health situation. The room had everything for all imaginable needs. Minoli was extremely careful and brought us everything that we asked for and she has often foreseen our needs. The sea water was extremely warm (at least 30 degrees Celsius all week) and the sun lounges sufficient at any given moment of the day. We were at 8 a.m. on the beach as the sea was calm. The food at the Hanaaya restaurant (both breakfast and dinner) was amazing – all tastes were satisfied, especially during the seafood/barbecue theme night. All the waiters were very friendly (especially Alex and Gerts) and they served instantly my wife according to her food allergy and intolerancies (especially Ella and Milumi). At the beach all of the employees were extremely friendly (especially Ashraf, Didar and Yam Jung) and they brought us a lot of towels and water in a special leather box with ice. Affan at the reception was especially professional in all his service. Amanda (the paramedic of the resort) helped my wife with her strained ankle and eased the pain. 
At the entrance to the beach there was SPF sun cream 30 and 50, children inclusive,mist-spray for face, glasses-cleaning service, free ice-cream and fruit lollipops. In the room there were constantly at least 2 liters of water. We got as soon as we arrived a clothing drier in the balcony.
At dinner there is tonic water and iced tea for free, for every other drink you had to pay. In comparison, at Kitchen Connection (the buffett restaurant of Jumeirah Beach hotel) and at Zheng He restaurant we had to pay even for water or tea.
For us , Hanaaya was the best location for breakfast and dinner and we enjoyed every bite.
All in all, we warmly recommend this hotel and we wish to return in a very near future.",5,2024-10-28T04:43:27Z

This place defines ‘hospitality’. Too many staff to mention by name except one who couldn’t have done more to make our stay as enjoyable as possible. Thank you to Rayhan who looked after us on the beach everyday. Always smiling, nothing is too much trouble, people like him make the difference at luxury hotels. Thank you.",5,2024-10-26T01:53:05Z
19,4,Mina A'Salam Madinat Jumeirah,302465.0,Excellent stay at this hotel. The service is almost perfect. The team at the Alam lounge and club pool were top notch. Very attentive and polite. Cleaning and housekeeping was also very good . The only exception is the Bahri bar where you aren’t made to feel welcome. If you want a good place to stay with in resort restaurants but being able to explore Dubai you need look no further.,5,2024-10-25T02:00:23Z

The staff at this hotel were incredibly welcoming once we reached the hotel, helpful throughout our stay. great location and near for walking and shopping (Souk Madinat). the beach was wonderful, spacious room with an unforgettable design, the housekeeping team is so friendly and ready to help.

one of the best things ever that the Gym is near we have been lucky to be close to, wowwww such an amazing facility everything is clean and well maintained, we enjoyed well our swimming, 
the   receptionist Ms. Zeynep was beautifully hosting, generous   and every time we came to Gym she had a nice smile, offering the jus and handling our request with care she even pointed some area in Dubai that we never heard about where we enjoyed our vacation more, we will be coming back next year in October wish to be seeing you again next year.

Some areas in the bathroom were broken, had mold or mildew. Bed was comfy but was rudely awakened at 10am on the day of check out when we already told the front desk we were checking out by 12pm. Seemed to be miscommunication between workers and they did not leave a good memorable impression. I’d rather stay at another high end hotel.",3,2024-10-27T21:09:35Z

All staff I encountered were friendly, helpful and professional.  I remember Dave, the valet, DJ, or PJ (big dark skinned guy) checked me in at the front desk and I'd like to single out Connell and his team in the security office.  I had a special need after my stay and they handled it competently and professionally. Thank you again.  Next time I need to stay in the area, I'll be back.",5,2024-11-01T20:35:45Z
27,6,W San Francisco,81669.0,Room was fine but the hidden fees are astounding. Staff was not upfront about how the destination fee worked and the fine print seemed intentionally obtuse and hidden. The room itself was fine and met expectations. Value for money was poor.,2,2024-10-20T21:05:15Z
28,6,W San Francisco,81669.0,"I wanted to love this hotel. But I’ve now stayed there twice and it is way too loud. The walls are paper thin so anything happening in the hallway or room next to you, you hear. This means you hear the loud machine in the hallway (maybe AC), your neighbors cell phone, everything. If you have bad luck you’re next to the elevator.
Also, the Bonvoy breakfast is not good.
If you’re a heavy sleeper go for it but I won’t be back.

The people working at the front desk were so lovely to talk to. They gave us tickets to the MOMA, tickets for the tram, and two water bottles that we used to refill throughout our stay. The room is average but no complaints on cleanliness and it had everything we needed. When in a city like this one not much time is spent in the hotel room. The lobby has very much a club vibe with a DJ and bar lounge area. We stayed in a high floor so we were not impacted by any noise. The location was great.",4,2024-07-30T09:30:51Z
30,6,W San Francisco,81669.0,"Hotels need to be first and foremost supportive of their guests.   With Marriott I expect excellent support for business guests.  Unlike other expensive Marriott hotels, breakfast is not free at W.   Worse yet, you end up waiting in line to get a table, waiting for the food, and waiting for the bill (which is obserdly expensive $20 for oatmeal???).   The ultimiate insult is the business center (which I had to use when my PC broke down).   They have the nerve to charge $30/hour for the PC and paper is $0.50/page (if I remember correctly).   This feels like a setup to take advantage of their guest - it's certainly not a level of support that I have come to expect from Marriott.

I don't know who they plan on hosting at W, but I recommend that business travelers skip this one.",3,2024-07-10T10:33:27Z

35,7,Hotel D'angleterre,232092.0,"This is a mixed bag… read on for my honest thoughts. The hotel is absolutely beautiful. Service is excellent, restaurant the best we dined at in the city. There were lovely treats unexpectedly left for us daily! Beds were very comfortable. Location is excellent. All of that said, our enjoyment of the hotel was hampered by a) broken a/c in one room, not fixed for 24 hours (for which we received a 50% refund for that room but caused sleep disruption) and b) the smallest amount of storage I’ve ever seen in a hotel. We had a junior suite and adjoining room.the suite had room to hang maybe 6 items, and there was ONE small drawer. As we were staying for 5 nights and this was the beginning of a longer trip, we had much more clothing than the room could accommodate. We were living out of our suitcases which made the room feel very cramped. The result was that we felt the cost very high relative to our experience, and a sense of relief to be able to unpack at the next destination. I would only recommend this hotel for a 1-2 night stay, or perhaps verifying in advance that your particular room has ample storage. Our group of 4 had 1 checked bag per person to give you a sense of our packing- not meager but not ridiculous.",4,2024-08-24T09:10:56Z
36,8,Shangri-La Sydney,256528.0,"Hubby & I have just celebrated our 40th wedding anniversary at Shangri la Sydney.
I chose this particular hotel over other similar 5 star hotels in the Sydney CBD for several different reasons.  One of those primary reasons was that decades ago, we stayed with Shangri la following our engagement.  Gosh, such a long time ago.
Another major consideration was that we’d planned dinner at the Altitude Restaurant which sits on level 36 of the hotel.

So, in terms of the accommodation.
The good points.  I had booked a Deluxe King Harbour Bridge room which had great views over the Bridge & Opera House. The package I selected included breakfast for two in Cafe Mix & parking pre booked parking at the hotel at $85.
The total package for the accommodation package was $655 which did not include credit charge surcharge fee of $12 (equates to 2%).

Upon arrival at reception, we were given a room upgrade to an Executive Harbour King Room on level 31. This was appreciated but it’s very similar to existing booking.  A lovely touch was that they sent a bottle of champagne & chocolates to the room as well as a small fruit platter.  Very much appreciated. The room was spotlessly clean. Impressive bathroom, & comfy king bed.  

The disappointing points:
When we returned to the room after a walk & lunch, we went to make a cup of coffee & discovered they had forgotten to include coffee cups with all the usual other amenities. Zero cups. Rang housekeeping who said they’d bring up 2 cups but after half an hour, nothing materialised.
It was more than an hour which included several other calls to reception & housekeeping before finally 2 cups were brought to the room.  It was a long wait just to have a cup of coffee.

Breakfast in Cafe Mix on Level 1 was extremely crowded, noisy, and somewhat chaotic. People everywhere, noisy & tables very close together. The buffet was ok & fairly comprehensive but I think just the volume of people, & just the sense of organised chaos made it less pleasant.  Eggs & omelettes have to be ordered from the table, which is fine in one respect, but it just means that half your breakfast is obtained at the buffet, & the other half having to be ordered at the table & then waiting for it to be delivered.
Hint: if required, order first, otherwise the rest of your breakfast will be cold by the time your order arrives.

I’ve learned something.  If I was to stay again, I would definitely choose a room that had the Horizon Club Access.  We could see the Club Lounge on Level 30 below us & it looked terrific , quiet, private & offering all day access to refreshments & canapés. On our return to the room, we could see the people in the club lounge having a beautiful, quiet & peaceful breakfast.  

Overall, a very nice stay, just things I would do different next time.",4,2024-11-11T21:44:17Z
37,8,Shangri-La Sydney,256528.0,"Five night stay on a club floor. We loved the view toward Darling Harbor. Our room was immaculate and daily refresh was non-obtrusive, often while we were at Breakfast in the Club Lounge. The food was nice and service was excellent. The staff was very engaging and clearly recognized us starting on the second day!The lounge could be very busy between about 8 and 9.  They make eggs and coffee to order and most of the rest was buffet. I liked the Congee and the fruit. My spouse is more interested in eggs, bacon and pastries! We stopped by twice in the evening and had wine and canapés before heading to dinner. The only downside is the 3 block hike up the hill from the Circular Quay. You can avoid one block by entering on the lower level! Even with the walk I would stay there again!",5,2024-11-08T22:36:06Z
38,8,Shangri-La Sydney,256528.0,"Hotel has show ages, service has been slow, sometimes no housekeeping and sometimes room key can malfunction.

39,8,Shangri-La Sydney,256528.0,"A great hotel with superb views over Sydney Harbour. It is worth investing in the best room with a view you can afford. Each day you get another view of the harbour which is constantly changing. Breakfast at Mix Cafe is ok, lots of choice if a little odd way of ordering fried eggs. Staff are all pleasant and helpful except for one person at breakfast who was particularly unpleasant, so much so I had to report them to the manager. That said, it was the only unpleasantness we experienced.",4,2024-10-31T23:59:47Z

Paid extra for a room with a view, and it was an amazing view of both the Harbor Bridge and the Opera House!  (Would have missed fireworks over the Opera House had we not had views from our room!). Wonderful fluffy bathrobes, slippers, well equipped room, comfy bed, and excellent buffet breakfast.   Happened to arrive to check in during a big wedding, so lobby was packed.  But once things settled down we really enjoyed the hotel.  Highly recommend!",5,2024-10-30T04:20:53Z
41,9,W Montreal,497207.0,"I stayed here for the Montreal Jazz Festival. I had a great stay -- excellent location and a nice room. BUT when I left, they charged me for the room even though I had purchased the room using Bonvoy points -- so they used my points and charged my card so I paid twice for the same stay. WORSE STILL, their customer service does not respond to my attempts to resolve the issue so I'm having to file a claim through Marriott's Bonvoy program. So it's a nice hotel with a great location with CRAPPY customer service and FRAUDULENT billing. You have been warned!",1,2024-08-02T17:40:23Z
42,9,W Montreal,497207.0,"I stay at W Hotels all over the world for work, and this particular location has quickly become one of my favorites. On a whim, I chose Montreal for a fun and relaxing five-day getaway, a city I had not visited in 20 years. It was even better than I remembered.

The hotel rooms are spacious and immaculate, and the location is fantastic. The service is exceptional, from the doorman to the front desk staff and housekeeping. Everyone is friendly and helpful. As a lifetime platinum member with Marriott, I felt particularly well taken care of.

The beds are incredibly comfortable, and the rooms are quiet at night. I usually struggle to sleep well, but I slept soundly here.

I would like to acknowledge a couple of exceptional staff members:

	•	Mauricio from the W Insider team truly stood out. I sent him some optimistic requests via email just before our arrival, and he even called me back on a Saturday evening from his home. He assured me he would personally chase down each request and do his best to fulfill them. He connected us with Veronique, who helped make everything happen and kicked off our trip in true W style. The team care was exceptional. Thank you, Mauricio and Veronique, for being the perfect W Ambassadors.

	•	Daniel at the TBSP restaurant on-site provided fantastic service. We enjoyed breakfast there every day because it was truly exceptional. The crispy breakfast potatoes are, without a doubt, the best I have ever had anywhere in the world. Daniel took care of us each day, providing excellent service, engaging conversation, and great advice. By the second day, he even remembered our quirky orders. He truly made our breakfast experience enjoyable and started each day on a high note. Thank you, Daniel.

I am eager to return and I will recommend it to friends who are looking for a great getaway at a wonderful hotel in a fun and friendly city.",5,2024-07-24T21:07:06Z
43,9,W Montreal,497207.0,"Decided to celebrate husband’s 40th birthday in Montreal, best decision! ❤️ The hotel staff made our stay really special,  when we got to our room we were welcomed with a birthday present and a note, which made us feel special 🥹 They were very polite throughout the whole stay. For our son  they printed cartoon images so he could draw, which made breakfast time so much easier.
The food was something else, not the typical (not so good) hotel food, we had breakfast everyday there and would still do if we lived closed by 🤭 
The suite was clean, the surrounding area also.
The location is great, walk in distance to the cathedral, and it has a door downstairs for easy access to the train station.",5,2024-05-29T22:59:30Z
44,9,W Montreal,497207.0,"OMG DONT STAY HERE LEAVE IMMEDIATELY AND RUN AWAY!!! DONT BOOK AND DONT THINK THERE REVIEWS ARE FALSE! I had booked a e wow room that is worth $1000 night and there is no service. The employees are uneducated workers in hospitality it seems as this is the only hotel of over 300 plus hotels we have stayed in which are always 5 star on suites. Upon checking in no valet or bell service and had to bring out 6 luggage on stairs and the clueless lady working said hi checking in. We said no one here is can help us with luggage. She said I’m sorry he is in a phone right now. What???? On your phone during work!!!! Then we checked in was not nice gave us keys and even still did not offer any luggage assistance to room at all!!!!! So terrible !!! When we went in room which we stayed here before they gave us the wrong room!!! We reserved a specific room and they had initially told us we will make sure you get one of the 2 e wow suites but they gave us the worst one of all!!!! Not only that floors are scratchy and dirty mold on desk and water inside the desk!!! I have photos which I will publish nasty! Then we asked for a rollaway and some guy brought it up and said “I don’t know how to set it up can you do it “ and left the pillow on the dirty floor!!! Photos taken… what !!!!! What service is this !!!! This is worst then a 1 star motel if I had option to leave a zero I will happily do this! Also I had someone coming to stay next week here and told them to cancel since the service and rooms are terrible!!! Complained to a manager and they didn’t care at all with attitude. The worst manager was Francois !!! He needs to be fired or moved to a lower class of hotels! He never took care of us and was very rude , he has the worst customer service and was very unwelcoming. Even Vincent was not good at all- to be honest we never complain like this but this is the first time they had attitude issues back . Again do not stay here",1,2023-12-21T12:03:37Z
45,9,W Montreal,497207.0,"This was our first stay at a W, and it was quite an interesting experience. We had booked with a prepaid rate, but prices came down pretty drastically closer to our stay which was unfortunate. The club-like vibe is clearly targeted towards younger travelers, which is a matter of taste - it was extremely loud in the lobby in the evenings during our weekend stay. 

Our Fabulous room was very nice and spacious (though it was notably still going for a cheaper rate than we had paid). We were able to check-in early which was appreciated, but our room was setup for another guest who was apparently there for a conference - we only had amenities for one person instead of two. However, the bathtub took FOREVER to fill - after half an hour it was still not at a reasonable depth.

Breakfast for Platinum+ members included a main and a drink - these were generous portions and quite tasty. However, a huge issue is that service here was EXTREMELY slow - the restaurant wasn't at capacity so I think it was a staffing issue.

The concierge contacted us a few days ahead of our stay to ask if we had any special requests. I asked if there was a piano at the property -  while they did not have one, the concierges went out of their way to contact another hotel to arrange for me to practice on our second day in Montreal, which was very thoughtful. Although I would have appreciated if this was done before we arrived, I appreciated that they went above and beyond for our request.

Breakfast was incorrectly charged to our folio at check-out. While not quite as nice of a stay as at other luxury hotels, it was more fun at a good pricepoint.",4,2023-12-06T23:00:26Z
46,10,Pudong Shangri-La,307540.0,"After comprehensive consideration, I still chose this hotel. The hotel has been around for some years, but the five-star standard is beyond doubt. Although the facilities are slightly old, they are still relatively complete, clean and hygienic. The service is very good, the lobby, restaurant, and cleaning attitude are all very good. Several restaurants in the hotel are great, recommended, and reasonably priced. The deposit will be refunded quickly. Member booking points can also be redeemed for breakfast.

49,10,Pudong Shangri-La,307540.0,"For a premiere hotel the room was basic and dated. The Horizon Club staff were excellent but the food offer was very disappointing for tea, evening drinks and breakfast. We had lunch in the main buffet restaurant one day but the welcome was very poor and service unloving - shame since the food offer was very good. The river views are awesome but this would not persuade me to stay here again.",3,2024-10-12T14:28:46Z

There aren't too many choices for travelers in Surabaya looking for a 4-5 star hotel, and the Shangri La is one of those few. The quality of the rooms, the staff and the available amenities are superior to other hotels nearby. Given the superior quality of this hotel compared to others nearby, you would think that the cost would be unreasonable, but it is the exact opposite and the value of what you get is hard to find elsewhere.",5,2024-09-05T10:08:13Z

The staff are fantastic being well trained, pleasantly polite and very efficient. The rooms are nice, very clean and well prepared. The dining choices are  good ( Chinese, Japanese, Italian and buffet), and the food excellent, as is the value. There is also a very nice pool area and a music bar with a live band for the young at heart.

Javier and Jazmin of the concierge desk are extremely helpful and accommodating, Giovanni Valdez of the Tribu restaurant/bar is wonderful and the whole breakfast team is so lovely ('bienvenida a su casa' they say when I return to the hotel).

The attention to detail was fabulous! He was always responsive and made sure that each one of our guests was taken care of! The hotel decoration is beautiful and modern and the guestrooms are very spacious and very clean! The location was perfect as well, walking distance to many restaurants and cafes.

My experience with valet was AMAZING! The staff was VERY fast, professional, and safe with my car. This was one of the most well-run valet operations that I have experienced at a hotel. I actually had an opportunity to share my feedback with Ron, who I believe was the valet manager.

64,13,Ritz-Carlton Atlanta,86260.0,"The Ritz-Carlton, Atlanta is one of the hotels we have visited the most in recent years.  Its location in Downtown Atlanta had us come back this time for a football family weekend.  Since we would have been in and out of the hotel, we decided not to stay at Club Level but graciously were upgraded to one of these rooms with no Club Lounge access.  This is fair since you either have to pay for it for $100-$150 per person or use your Club Level certificates if you have the Ritz-Carlton credit card. 

During our stay, we did notice a few hiccups in terms of service, especially with the turndown service at night and the quality of the service in the bar area. However, it was a busy weekend, and we understand that things can get hectic. What stood out was the personal touch of the hotel's management. We had the opportunity to meet the GM, who was always around to assist and ensure guests were comfortable in the lobby area.  

I would say that I would highly recommend staying at the Club Level instead of the regular rooms, so you can experience the level of service provided in this hotel.  I am unsure if I would attempt to book a regular non-Club reservation again, but in the end, it was a great experience to be back in Atlanta after such a long time.  I will give kudos this time to all the employees of the AG restaurant, who always went above and beyond during breakfast and assisted us in an urgent matter.  Also, I would recommend trying the Million Peaches cocktail drink and ordering the Peach Crumble from the main restaurant.",4,2024-09-22T09:55:59Z

We checked in on Thursday, August 29 and just checked out yesterday. We had a great family reunion. Thank you, Pamrla Hughes for putting us in a great room! Normally at the Fairmont and at the Ritz, we get hors d’oeuvres and great mixed drinks in the Club/Gold level. This time at the Ritz, we actually got a full meal at dinner time. Every meal we ate was delicious! We were there six days and enjoyed every minute! I can only hope that Pamrla can give me the same experience again next year!  Everything about our stay was great! The mattress was so comfortable in our room and the jerk chicken, lamb and all the other food we ate in the club lounge was spectacular!  And don’t let me not forget to mention the drinks. Let me see if I can attach the Club level drink menu. I guess the only criticism I can think of is that we didn’t have access to free-flowing alcohol as we have in past years. It’s OK. We enjoyed delicious drinks and we are not big drinkers!! Thank you again for a great stay!   John",5,2024-09-04T12:36:23Z

68,14,The Ritz-Carlton Osaka,302242.0,"This was my first trip to Japan, and the hotel, hospitality and service here was spectacular! 

The Ritz is located in a posh shopping area where you can walk a few steps outside the hotel and see high-end stores like Prada, Gucci, Hermes, etc. They have an underground tunnel connecting the property to the metro and multiple restaurants, a 7-1, department stores, and shops.

I arrived via Taxi from the airport, and there were multiple people outside of the hotel who warmly greeted me and assisted with bags. I was walked over to check in, where hotel manager, Simon checked me. Check in was fast, and was very informative and he was so friendly, and was patiently answering questions I had. I really appreciated that.
They did comment on my Titanium status level and had upgraded me to a very nice suite, and there were chocolates, fruit and a very nice handwritten note when I got to the room.

The room was very nicely appointed, and I appreciated a consistently filled in bottled water area. They stock 4 bottled waters in the morning and in the evening. The bathroom amenities were amazing. As an American, I’m not used to being given these items in our hotels in the U.S., hair bushes, bath salts, razors, toothbrushes and toothpaste, etc. There were also complementary coffee and tea, slippers, PJs, and a robe. I stayed for five nights, and it was extremely quiet during the daytime and nighttime. 

All of the people in the hotel, shops and restaurants were extremely warm and friendly. The hospitality here far exceeded my expectations.

The Ritz hotel very classically decorated, as usual, with lots of ornate wood, elegant fireplaces, and classic old-world elegance.

Mr. Finch -- the manager -- has obviously established a work environment that makes employees eager to help guests, particularly us non-Japanese speakers, easily navigate their way around all the great things to do and see (and eat) in Osaka.

The location is fantastic. Right on champs Élysée. Across the road from all the luxury stores like LV. 

You are invited in to a deep red, black and purple theme. It is hard to believe you can find so much space and peace amongst one of the most famous streets in the world. As soon as you step through the doors you are away from the chaos. 

We stayed in a deluxe suite which offered beautiful views and we even caught the tip of the Eiffel Tower. 

We ate at the restaurant and very much enjoyed all aspects of the property. 

I’m trying to think of negatives but I can’t. 
I had just come from a property in London which is more expensive than this. They were incomparable. Fouquet’s all day. 

I had also gone on to stay at another property in Paris which again, cost twice as much as this.

I would like to thank Ms.Zelin a receptionist who comes from China, she is lovely, from check-in to my room, she was helpful and amicable. 

However, breakfast is quite normal for a luxury hotel, not many things to choose and the staff did not explain the menu, he just came and asked me what I would like to order. Also from the beginning, I spoke French to him, but he avoided speaking it to me instead of speaking English which I did not understand why, I won't say I speak perfectly, but at least I can communicate without any difficulties.

Getting to the hotel from the airport, and back, can be challenging due to the hotel’s remote location. We booked a transfer with Emirates Transfer for 51 USD per trip. The service was excellent, and the hotel can also arrange a transfer if needed.

Thank you to all the staff for this unforgettable stay.",5,2024-11-14T05:05:26Z

So after visiting the resort a few years ago, I  realized then and there that there is no need to go to the Cayman Islands or Mexico or Bali. They cannot match the quality of the food, the pure relaxation of being on site at Cap Maison. After about 10 visits to date, I realize that when I come back home to the states, I am already missing my true home in St Lucia. BTW- the WiFi is excellent everywhere including the beach which is what makes everything that more perfect. Staff are wonderful. Food is Michelin quality. Ross is the best management one could have- always available and I am bringing another bottle of bourbon to him on my next visit.

While not an amazing suite, the room was also lovely and clean, well equipped, with seating space inside and out.  Our two nights felt a lot longer.

84,17,Cap Maison Resort & Spa,1091083.0,"Oh, what an amazing resort Cap Maison is! 

   My wife and I looked forward to our second visit there, but we were somewhat anxious since we had been here before many years ago, and thought maybe it will have lost some luster over time. Sometimes when you have  a great experience once, the second time isn't as good...possibly because you had experienced things anew, the unfamiliar can  offer unexpected surprises; or maybe we simply play things up in our memory more than we should. 
 
    I can tell you that once again though, we were simply blown away by Cap Maison! Yes, the resort is still singularly gorgeous, yes the venue for dining is spectacular, yes, the private roof top pool and huge villa rooms are comfortable and they boast great views...but the very best amenity they have are the amazing staff who work there, and the attention to detail they all extend to everyone.   

    From the beautiful Deverney, their helpful concierge, to Julian and staff at the spa, to Tyler and Darrell at the cliff restaurant, to Bob, the helpful and attentive beach server, and Robert the knowledgeable and friendly Sommelier...even the thorough house cleaning staff...I wish I could list them all! Wow! Always a yes, always a ""how can I assist?"", never without a smile or open greeting. I truly don't know how they do it...but the entire staff is a collective family who can't wait to embrace you as one of their own. 

   Don't miss dining one night on the small island Rock platform in the middle of the sea, or an intimate and very fun  private roof top Barb-q, or the private gazebo breakfast on the cliff, or the tasty wine tasting in the Cellar. The intimate spa lesson experience for couples is so fun, as we learned how to make each other relax with new skills as we learned about the science behind the mechanics of a massage. 

   Do you appreciate a talented bartender who remembers how you prefer your drink? You are covered here! This is the perfect romantic intimate getaway spot for a quiet, intimate, spectacularly luxurious experience. There are other great resorts on this West Indies island of St. Lucia, but I can tell you that Jade Mountain or Anse Chastenet are TWICE the cost as the Cap, and they offer a less personalized relaxing romantically unique experience. If an all inclusive experience is what you are after...The Cap Maison has a package for that here too...but on a scale that Sandals could only dream to provide. 

   Having been married for over thirty years, we know that more than a spark can be found at the Cap; so if you want to bring back the fire of your honeymoon back, just book yourself a trip here as a Christmas present to reward each other...you simply can't do better than this!

Sincerely, 
Charles & Jeanne

85,17,Cap Maison Resort & Spa,1091083.0,"Actually visited Feb 2023, but I don’t have the option to go back that far and am only just playing catch-up. 

We had a fantastic week at Cap Maison. Couldn’t fault the food, atmosphere, service or standard of the hotel. The beach was great - clean, good lifeguard service, and the Naked Fosherman was the perfect place to hang out for food and drinks. 

Our only comment (definately not a criticism) is that there isn’t too much for kids to do, so just think about this before booking. We bought four teenagers and they kept themselves busy, so it was no issue for us. It’s also at the very north of the island, which makes day trips to the centre/south/pitons that bit longer as the journey time increases.

A few reviews said to beware the steps up from the beach to the resort, but they really aren’t that bad at all if you’re in reasonable health!

It’s a fairly small resort, and if we were to return may split the week into two, and just have three or four nights here as some of the other guests were doing. 

Otherwise, it was almost perfect.",5,2024-08-30T08:01:40Z

91,19,The Resort at Paws Up,528223.0,"Some great aspects but one MAJOR issue. 
We booked our end of summer trip at paws up and we’re very excited to visit this “5-state luxury resort”. Upon arriving we quickly realized the communication from reception is basically zero. After waiting 4 hours post check-in (we arrived at 1pm, check in was 4…) we finally, after endless calls and texts to reception, got into the home we rented and it was disgusting…this was 8pm. Literally the sheets had dead bugs in them. There were dead flies everywhere. The linens weren’t clean and the floors hadn’t been vacuumed - it was like a bad dream. The staff said, “we have wildlife here” when I mentioned that the bed linens in the yurt looked as if wild animals had been sleeping in them.

I asked we be moved to other accommodations. Because there was a group of social media influencers there for Lexus, there wasn’t a home large enough for us and we had to split our family up into two properties no where near each other. 

The other properties were clean and we were grateful despite being exhausted from a full day of travel from the east cost and finally getting settled 9 hours after we arrived. 

The following morning we spoke with reception and said we’d like to put the nightmare check-in behind us and asked if the first night would be comped for the major inconveniences. The staff said they’d look into it. Two months later, we’ve still not heard back despite countless calls and promises they’d contact us. In fact my husband just called AGAIN about this tonight. 

The only other issue was that after our check-in experience, every staff member we encountered “knew who we were”….and not in a good way. I didn’t “lose it” on anyone, the reception staff even commented that they appreciated I wasn’t screaming at them. I’m a business owner and understand things happen - screaming at employees doesn’t solve anything for anyone. For every single staff member to make comments saying, “we know who you are” as if I had done something offensive was embarrassing- to say the least. 

As much as we enjoyed the food, day at Salmon lake, and ambiance - we won’t be returning. 

**last note that I understand is completely out of their control: the CA wildfires definitely dampened the experience. We stayed for 7 nights and it wasn’t until after it rained on the second to last day that we saw the mountains…it also gives you a wicked migraine- again, not in their control whatsoever but something to consider if you’re sensitive to smoke.",3,2024-11-06T18:32:59Z
92,19,The Resort at Paws Up,528223.0,"I delayed writing this, because as a business owner, I am not keen on public criticism.  However, I wrote Managment a letter, so they can know about some of the mishaps, and although I got a standard reply “we will get back to you in a few days” nobody did get back to me, so here goes…
1. Activities were cancelled at last minute with no communication, so we would basically arrive at an activity to be told it was cancelled.
2. Transportation, which we relied on, to get anywhere on the resort was unreliable, and sometimes we were stuck at places for over an hour.  Communication again was horrible.
3. The employees were incredibly nice but many did not understand English, so couldn’t answer basic questions….most of these were the butlers.  It became so awkward and uncomfortable and I truly felt terrible for them, as they were inadequately trained yet assigned to us as a “butler”.  Often times they gave us wrong times for an activity, didn’t have basic knowledge about how to get places, etc.
4. Housekeeping some times didn’t show, and once they came at 10pm to clean our tent.
5. Inside our glamping tent, there was no water pressure, the floor mat was old and shredded, and basically not up to par.

We were a family of 6 staying in a “glamping” grounds.  The pluses were the food, the chef at our campground was amazing (both a great cook and so kind) and the property is beautiful.  Also, the staff who led activities were knowledgeable and well trained.  Overall the staff was incredibly kind to us, but again, I felt bad because they were working in a very dysfunctional system.  The manager of our campground was responsive but usually putting out fires after the fact.  I felt bad for her as well.

This was not an experience worth the steep cost.  I hope the owners can get their act together and fix their problems.",2,2024-09-10T10:09:42Z
93,19,The Resort at Paws Up,528223.0,"This resort was a mess.  The staff was poorly trained, there was virtually no communication, and the place is ridiculously over priced.  Spent nearly $8,000 per night and there was no housekeeping for two days.  Had to demand service in order to get anyone to come to the house.  There was a loss of power and no water for 24 hours.  We were given bottled water to fill up the toilets.  Even though the power goes out regularly (we were told 4 times this summer) there are no flashlights provided to guests.  We were told none were kept at the homes because the guests were taking them home.  We requested a lantern and one was provided but there were no batteries.

All in all, I would never recommend this resort.",1,2024-08-31T16:15:07Z
94,19,The Resort at Paws Up,528223.0,"I used almost the same title as the review posted last week since our experience was very similar.  The lack of staff training causes frustration and stress numerous times each day.  Which, of course, is not what anyone wants on their vacation... especially one this ridiculously expensive.

In general it just seemed like no one was in charge and there was very little thought put into anything.  Even if our stay had cost far less than $5000 per night (plus $6000 for activities) we would've expected a competent, basic level of service.

Although it's tempting to list all the big and little things that caused so much frustration each day, I know that long reviews can be off-putting.  I'd recommend taking at face value the numerous reviews that mention poor training and service, since it seems this has been a problem for some time.  

One instance of the poor approach to service happened with our room.  We booked a ""Meadow Home,"" which the website describes as ""an ideal refuge for smaller families and couples on a quest for privacy.""  As it turns out this description was very misleading, as these are duplex homes with shared walls, very close to the public road which cuts straight through the property, and well within hearing range of the highway, the noise of which is nearly constant.  I stopped by the front desk to ask if  one of the Big Timber homes or the Wilderness Estates was available so we could move, and I was told by the manager he ""wasn't sure.""  He said he'd look into it and  get back to me later that day.  But.. he never did.  Just no response at all and didn't even mention it the next time I saw him.  Very nice guy but just didn't know the basics of customer service.

To echo the review from earlier this month, just about every staff person we met was super nice, and seemed to want to please, but was set up for failure by the evident lack of training and the apparent lack of thought behind how to run the resort.  

One example of the lack of thought and training was apparent during the barbecue dinner.  It was a buffet, and at most buffets you get your own food but order drinks from your server.  Here there are no servers at the dinner buffets  (although no one tells you that when you arrive or sit down).  So, after the four of us got our food I went to the bar to order cocktails for my wife and myself... and by the time I got back to the table with the drinks twenty minutes later everyone had already finished eating.  Part of the reason the drinks took so long is the bartender - and this is no exaggeration - had to look down at the drink recipe every time he added an ingredient.  

So, a perfect example of how a lack of thought on the part of management (have servers!) and a lack of training for the staff (teach bartenders how to make basic drinks!) combined to make what should have been an enjoyable experience frustrating.  

I could go on but I would simply caution anyone booking a trip here to temper their expectations, and be prepared to be frustrated.  

One note on the actvities - stick to the ""nature"" ones.  The activities that require the most thought and planning on the part of resort management are disappointing - for example, the ropes course is small and not even as good as the one near where we live in New England, and the paintball ""field"" is basically just a bunch of pallets placed semi-strategically in a very small area.  All the activities are overpriced, but these in particular seemed to rise to the level of blatant rip-off - almost $700 for four people for about an hour on a ropes course!

One other thing I have to note was the oppressive number of flies and bees during meals.  We're used to eating outdoors but have never seen anything like the massive number of flies and Yellowjackets that were present at every outdoor meal - and even once during an indoor breakfast.  Flies all over not only our food at our table, but also all over the food at the buffet.  You had to be careful lifting your glass to your mouth in case a Yellowjacket was sitting on the rim.  And it wasn't just us - we heard numerous other people complain about this.  We asked our lunch server why they don't just put up fans, which could easily be done at the The Shed, which is the main lunch spot, and she said ""We keep asking but we're always told they wouldn't look acceptable.""  As much as the fans might not look great, they'd be vastly preferable to having your for constantly covered by flies.

We definitely had some memorable experiences, in particular the fly fishing.  But, based on the overall experience we wouldn't go back.  The next time we head to Montana or somewhere in the area for this type of vacation we'll explore other options.",3,2024-08-23T15:36:51Z

At this point, I don’t think the team have ever been more effective in ensuring a good stay. I haven’t yet met the new GM, but it’s apparent that he’s doing a great job. There’s a lot of key staff who are still present from several years before, whether it’s the butlers, the bar team, or the two guys who stand outside all day helping with luggage, their professionalism has obviously filtered down to the new hires, who are exceptional. 

The staff always say hello to me by name. It feels friendly, not forced. Nothing ever seems to be any trouble, the lady who cleans every day was just brilliant too. Walking back in to a suite that looked like it had just been returned to perfect everyday is a lovely feeling. Honestly, this woman is a housekeeping genius. 

And lastly, the upgrade I received was such a generous gesture. I maybe expected that I’d get a room with a better view as I’ve been so many times, but I was given such a treat. Heartfelt thanks. Unexpected, yet hugely appreciated. 

See you all in February when I return with my family for another 4 night break.

100,20,Sofitel Amsterdam The Grand,189389.0,"On many levels a great hotel- fantastic location, large rooms, decent breakfast. Excellent concierge and friendly staff. However the polish from a 5* hotel that you expect was missing - I emailed in advance for an early check in (we were travelling with children on a very early morning flight) and they understandably said there was no guarantee, but then on arriving at the hotel they were unsure about availability and told us to come back an hour before their standard check in time - which we did, only to sit there for another hour waiting in the lobby. In being shown to the room eventually only one of the 2 connecting rooms was ready and our bags, which had now  been at the hotel for 5 hours already were no where to be seen and had to be chased. Poor. Ditto on checking out having asked for our bags to be brought down whilst we were having an early breakfast, we again stood in the lobby trying to track them down while our pre booked taxi waited:  the bags were still in the room! Twice we were also asked to sign/ pay for breakfast when this was included in our rate. Rooms were spacious, if a bit tired, and bathrooms lacked hooks, and didn’t have toothbrushes or razors, plus were accessed by a big black marble step, that at night needed a white towel placed over it for fear of smacking into it! A good hotel but the ‘admin bit’ of looking after guests was not great- and not what you would expect from this type of hotel.",3,2024-10-26T01:29:04Z

I made an error when booking our tickets and did not find out till we were about to hop on the bus. Went back to Eugene and he had it all sorted with a smile and a “not to worry, it’s all sorted”. No penalty on the tickets, gave us our new voucher and off we went. Every time we needed assistance, Eugene came up with the answers. If only every hotel had a Eugene. Pier One you are very lucky to have this awesome concierge as your employee.
Thank you also to Vanessa, we enjoyed our drinks evening, conversation over breakfast, you also added to our enjoying our stay at Pier One.",5,2024-11-05T11:18:03Z

108,22,One&Only Reethi Rah,256653.0,"We stayed at this hotel twice during our 21 day odyssey of Australia and New Zealand, each time for 3 days.  Both times, it was terrific.  The location is perfect - right in the middle of things.  We had an awesome water view.  The hotel is right by the bridge, with Circular Quay and the Opera House, just a short walk away.  The hotel staff were amazing:  polite, professional and endlessly helpful.  Our room was lovely and very comfortable.  When we returned to Sydney the second time and came back to Pier One, it almost felt like coming home.  And, I can't forget to mention the fantastic breakfast :)",5,2024-10-18T20:33:39Z
109,22,One&Only Reethi Rah,256653.0,"We chose the hotel for its location. Definitely a good decision. The location was good for Circular Quay and other tourist spots. The breakfast was good and we also enjoyed the bar. 

A nice comfy bed and a view of the bridge from our room were a bonus.",4,2024-10-17T12:00:56Z
110,22,One&Only Reethi Rah,256653.0,"Despite requesting a quiet room twice during the reservation process we were placed close to the entrance to the bridge on the second floor which serves as a wedding venue. So we had issues getting to and from the room in addition to a lot of noise particularly at the conclusion of the second wedding that night.  Given the rate one pays I don’t think it’s acceptable to place non wedding guests in these rooms. There should be a much greater degree of separation. As such I can’t recommend anyone to stay at this hotel at these times. There are much quieter hotels available in Sydney where function rooms are well away from guest rooms. Sorry Pier One, you can’t have your wedding cake and eat it - ie pack in as many weddings and guests as you can with your current layout.",3,2024-10-05T17:11:01Z
111,23,Four Seasons Las Vegas,91674.0,"Great hotel at one end of the strip.  I love how people talk about there's no casino - which is true - but there's literally a ""trap door"" to get into the Mandalay Bay casino.  So, you get the best of both worlds at FS.  You will be met by multiple people every time you arrive, return or depart.   The rooms are quite large and recently re-done.  The lobby and bar area are nice, smaller and quiet compare to what you find in LV.  Weekend brunch is the legendary version this hotel brand has offered since the 1990's.  We will definitely stay again.  Easy check in and check out - similar to another hotel within a hotel along the strip.  Buyer beware:  The Spa Bar is no longer walk-in and traffic along the strip is at an all-time insane high.",5,2024-11-10T23:10:35Z
112,23,Four Seasons Las Vegas,91674.0,"I arrived on a Friday afternoon at 5pm. I booked a Strip View room and upon check in was told the room wasn't ready. Was told they would rush and try to get it ready within the hour. An hour passed an it wasn't ready.

I had a dinner reservation at 8 and seeing as I needed a room to get ready, I told the front desk that I would accept any available room. ""Sorry sir, were at a high occupancy last night and fully booked tonight""

I went online to check availability, and for the 3 nights that I was there all but Executive and One bedroom Suites remained. I was told that the only way I would get a suite would be to pay for the difference in rate. I refused and suggested that all I needed was a room for 30 minutes to change and shower . After that, I wouldn't require a room until after 11pm. Manager came out, apologized repeatedly but denied my request.

I contemplated booking another hotel and cancelling this but again, the Four Seasons denied this and said I would be charged a full night penalty if I did.  

They checked my bags, I went to dinner. Came back at 11:35pm and the room STILL wasn't ready. I finally got keys at 11:55pm and without one single apology.

Received a call from a manger the next morning to apologize. I asked for a rate reduction for the 1st night and she made it seem as if I was asking for a million dollars.
2 hours later and they agreed to a discounted rate.

I understand rooms may be delayed, but it was the disinterested attitude from the management that made it unpleasant.

Bathroom with the shower and bath tub met our expectations for a Four Seasons resort.  The location worked out perfectly as our main event was the Chiefs/Raiders game at Allegiant Stadium.  Loved the oasis this hotel provided for us with the pool, lobby bar and Veranda restaurant.  All the staff we encountered were very nice and helpful from check-in to check-out.  In particular Lauren in the Veranda restaurant.  We had lunch there multiple times and she always remembered us and gave us wonderful service.",5,2024-10-29T07:29:57Z
115,23,Four Seasons Las Vegas,91674.0,"I stayed at the Four Seasons Las Vegas for one night, expecting the high level of service that the brand is known for. Unfortunately, my experience fell far short of that standard.

Upon checking into my room, I noticed a brown stain on my bed, so I called down to request fresh sheets. No one ever came to replace them, but I did receive a polite apology email through my Expedia profile. While the apology was appreciated, I would have preferred if someone had actually come and addressed the issue.

Room service that evening was also disappointing. I ordered a burger and asked specifically for extra condiments, but none arrived. After waiting for 15 minutes, ketchup was finally brought up—by then, my food was cold and unenjoyable. I also ordered the seasonal cheesecake, which I was told would be mango-flavored, but I received a plain cheesecake with a side of blackberries instead.

Overall, the experience felt more like a budget hotel than a luxury stay. Given the many other options in Las Vegas for the same price, I wouldn’t recommend this particular Four Seasons. It just didn’t live up to the brand’s reputation.",1,2024-10-24T10:47:52Z

121,25,Hotel de la Cite,197023.0,"Attended a conference here in a centre next to main hotel. Location in the fortified medieval town is interesting and it is next to the main church. The old town is car-, bus- and taxi-free (you only get taken to the gates in the medieval walls), although people staying at Hotel de la Cite can use a special hotel taxi.
Good facilities: 4 rooms for ~50 people each, 3 rooms can be opened up together for a plenary session  (150 people).
Entrance hall for reception desk/displays/posters.
Light refreshments were served in a marquee outside the main building. We enjoyed a lunch in the main hotel. The evening dinner for 150 was held in the conference centre turned into a restaurant.

Unfortunately, this is the end of the praise: the room is ok, but not amazing, breakfast is ok, but not great. The coffee lacks quality and consistency. The worst is the service. All staff members barely smile and I would even go that far to say there is no service at all. The car park is an extra €30,- per night which is ridiculous and the shuttle service expects a tip, which we refused to give, especially when the shuttle is a dirty and dusty car. If you want a drink you have to go and look for someone to serve you, noone is clearing the table. If it weren't for the location, this would range around 3*.",3,2024-10-20T11:24:03Z
123,25,Hotel de la Cite,197023.0,"As has been said before, location is superb and beautiful historic building. But I wouldn’t class it as 5 star. Our request for a walk in shower made several weeks in advance seemed to cause a problem but was quickly sorted by Sophie and we were given a junior suite. As it wasn’t ready, we went to garden and ordered a drink at the bar. 30 minutes later still no sign of drinks and had to go back in and collect them ourselves. Husband used the pool each day but no cushions on any of the loungers round the pool and no one to ask for any. Breakfast was excellent but no one told us we could order omelettes etc until our last day. Rooms are a bit tired and need a refresh. Handle to bathroom broke and I was stuck there for over half an hour while maintenance men tried to get me out! All very amusing but dread to think what would have happened in a fire. I would have thought that management might have followed this up to see I was ok but no! I did enjoy my stay here but it wasn’t without issues",4,2024-10-07T06:00:51Z
124,25,Hotel de la Cite,197023.0,"This is an excellent hotel in a great location. Staff was friendly and helpful. We booked a Junior Suite. Although not really a suite (just a large room) the room was well done with a large balcony. 

I have a couple of reasons for taking off a star. First, I could hear the people in the room above walking and the room next door talking. This is a pet-peeve as when I want to sleep, I need quiet and not muffled conversation and laughter in the room next door. Second is the balcony smoking policy. Along with being up late talking, they also sat on the balcony and smoked which blew directly into our balcony and room if the window was open. This meant that unless I wanted to sit and smell smoke, the balcony was useless to me. I understand that I'm not the only guest, I just shouldn't be able to hear or smell the others when in my room.

125,25,Hotel de la Cite,197023.0,"Stayed here due to the perfect location for our 2 night stay but we were disappointed with our room (305). 

Albeit that it was in the same style as the pictures on the website, the room was really small, had no kettle (which we had to ask twice to get it replaced), no comfortable armchairs as advertised and only 2 bath towels (further towels were produced later on). 

Although there was a built in hanger / wardrobe unit there were no drawers anywhere so we literally had to live out of our suitcase - which we most certainly didn’t expect to do at the price we paid. 
But, there was a table with an uncomfortable old chair in front of it - but no mirror or power sockets etc so other than popping the kettle on there it didn’t really serve a purpose. We had to stand the kettle on the floor to plug in and boil. Not ideal !

We were offered to have our room changed the following day, but felt that was rather too late and too much of a hassle. 

Strangely, we had a dog bowl in the bathroom. It felt like we had been moved around for the benefit of someone else yet we had booked this nearly a year in advance. 

The inside bar was also not available in the evenings which seemed a bit bizarre 

The staff were pleasant enough and our pick up transfer driver was delightful - and the location was perfect. 

We did try to contact the hotel to give our feedback privately but had no response - so felt there was no alternative other than to complete this review here.  And would like add that we have never done a negative review on here either - that’s not the way we operate. 

Would definitely recommend that anyone staying there checks the amenities etc in their room.",3,2024-09-04T04:51:10Z

133,27,Belmond Casa de Sierra Nevada,152833.0,"I don't usually write reviews, but I felt like I had to after our stay at the Belmond last week.  This might be the best hotel we have ever stayed at, anywhere in the world.  First, the interiors and courtyards are immaculate and absolutely beautiful, with greenery everywhere and incredibly tasteful decor throughout.  It feels both luxurious and cozy at the same time, a place you immediately feel comfortable in and never want to leave.  The main restaurant, Andanza, has a courtyard dining area that looks like a painting.  Breakfast there every morning was one of the highlights of our trip, and dinner was equally delicious.  The pool area is gorgeous, with ivy and bougainvilleas covering the surrounding buildings that house the suites.  The rooftop bar, Tunki, was our favorite spot in town for cocktails - the view is incredible and the drinks are creative and well balanced (as would be expected from a partnership with the recently crowned #1 bar in the world, Handshake).  Every room is unique, and our Deluxe Studio Suite was a great place to retreat to after a day of walking around town.  It had beautiful wood ceilings, a huge bathrom with a closet, tub and both indoor and outdoor showers, along with a private patio with a heated plunge pool.  My understanding is that all of these suite types are located in the building(s) around the pool area, which feels like you're in some kind of dream.

The aesthetics of the entire property are just top notch.  But what truly sets this hotel apart is the service.  It was, hands down, the best service we have ever received.  Every single employee took so much pride in their work and went the extra mile to make our stay special.  Two small examples: 1) while ordering breakfast my wife asked what ""xoconostle"" was.  Not only did they explain that it was a cactus fruit, but a few minutes later they brought out a cut fruit so we could see what it looked like, along with a pico de gallo with diced xoconostle in it so we could sample the flavor in a typical Mexican preparation.  Another night, we were admiring the handwoven drink coasters at Tunki.  The server noticed and explained where they were made, and offered to let us take a couple of them home with us to help remember our stay.  These are just two small things... they also always greeted us by name, helped us with reservations, brought us breakfast extra early on our day of departure, etc... but it is indicative of the level of thought and care that every single employee put into their craft (and it really does feel like they treat service as a craft to be perfected).   Our room was cleaned seemingly every time we left it for any period of time, often with a note or a treat left behind for us.  The spa was equally attentive and the massages were great.  Yes, we had some small issues with water pressure and temperature in the main shower, but that is to be expected in a 17th century building and we had another shower and bath tub to use anyway.  I just can't say enough good things about this place.  Yes, the rooms are expensive, but I found the food, drinks, and spa prices to be very reasonable - especially considering the quality.  Bottom line: if you are considering a trip to San Miguel and you have the means to stay at Casa Sierra de Nevada, don't hesitate and just book it.  You won't regret it.",5,2024-10-28T17:49:58Z

Every touch was above and beyond. The art throughout the halls, the fresh breakfast in the morning, drinks on the patio, dinner at El Olivo. We fed the donkeys and relaxed by the pool.

Breakfast is a real treat with everything you could wish for again with wonderful service. Deia has some great restaurants too and the hotel is within very easy walking distance. We drove from the airport which took about 40 minutes although it is up some narrow winding roads into the mountain so may not be for everyone! I think a taxi is about 60 euros.

151,31,Four Seasons Mexico City,152463.0,"The Four Seasons, Mexico City is a beautiful hotel with lovely rooms, awesome management and a hard-working staff.  They showed me hospitality at the highest level.  I happened to come during the holidays and experienced a magical vacation thanks to the people who work there. It was above and beyond my expectations, and they went all out for their holiday decorations which were so festive, colorful and put you in the holiday spirit. No other hotel could compete with The Four Seasons, Mexico City’s Christmas tree or holiday decorations. They outdid themselves!

I feel that any time of the year would be the perfect time to visit The Four Seasons, Mexico City because it was that awesome! The personalized service and their desire to make your stay above and beyond seemed to be their goal and they mastered that!

There are so many people to thank for such a unique, personalized and amazing vacation. 

TULIO H. – He was an incredible GM, who was visible every day at the resort and was nice enough to hold multiple conversations with me throughout my entire stay. It was so nice to see him never too busy for his guests.  He was always friendly and down-to-earth. That was refreshing. He set such a good example for working hard day in and day out and that empowered his staff to do the same, and go above and beyond for the guests. 

OCTAVIO M. – He was an excellent hotel manager. He was available every day and was accessible to interact and speak with guests. I had great interactions with him throughout my stay. It was really nice to see how humble he was. He delivered on having his hotel and his team members create the most unique, personalized and wonderful vacation! He was a good listener and cared so much about guests’ satisfaction.  I appreciated the time, energy and effort he made to ensure that I had the best time at The Four Seasons, Mexico City. It was so enjoyable that I think about my trip all the time, and refer back to my pictures because it was such a one-of-a-kind vacation that exceeded my expectations!  I saw his hard work each day and that motivated his team members to give each guest the best vacation memories they’ve ever had. I was impressed with Octavio M’s leadership and the way his team members were instrumental in curating a vacation that I’ll never forget!

LAURA V. – She created a unique experience on the rooftop with a skating rink that was unlike anything I’ve ever seen or experienced. She should be commended for finding a way for guests and the community to experience such a joyful activity that everyone seemed to love and enjoy on the rooftop of the hotel. I don’t know how she came up with such an awesome idea, but I saw for myself first-hand how it brought adults, kids and hotel guests together in such a wonderful way.  I’ve never seen anything like it, and I loved every minute of it! I thoroughly enjoyed that unexpected experience. It was like a party on the roof that was brought to life by Laura and The Four Seasons, Mexico City. So very cool!

JESUS FROM THE CONCIERGE TEAM – He went above and beyond my expectations. He did an excellent job with surprising me with a photo shoot all around the hotel in my native cultural clothes. He picked the best spots and took the most amazing pictures and videos. He captured such special memories that I will always have because of his creativity, thinking outside the box and wanting to give me an experience that I’ve never been lucky enough to have. Those pictures and videos are unlike anything that anyone has ever captured before and it brings such heartfelt memories of my trip. The awesome experiences Jesus created were the highlights and nicest surprises from my trip.  It was obvious Jesus put forth so much effort in exceeding my expectations, and he really impressed me with his talents, care and concern. He was a shining star!

XIMENA – She did a great job jumping into action to help with taking pictures and videos when needed.

CONCIERGE TEAM – They were the most detailed, high-level staff with the most dedicated team members I have seen at any resort! They were available late into the night and early morning every day and honestly when you needed them, they were always there to help. Every single concierge team member took so much pride in their work that their expertise and their recommendations always led them to create an amazing itinerary for me. It was so obvious their goal was for the guests to have the best time in Mexico City, and they took it very seriously to make sure you enjoyed each and every day at the hotel and in the city. I’ll never forget how much they cared!

AMY T. – She was a wonderful room ambassador and she did a great job from check-in, throughout my stay and check-out. She was always available and a great resource if I needed anything.

LINDSAY W. – She did a nice job with pre-arrival correspondence. 

KASSANDRA M. – She gave out very helpful arrival information and confirmation.

RICARDO – Was very helpful with my luggage and information about my room, the hotel and the city. 

EDUARDO AT IL BECCO – Wonderful mixologist, who served me a very creative twist on a Limoncello drink.

IL BECCO – Wonderful Italian restaurant with hard-working team members who provided a lovely dining experience. 

YOATZIN – Was a wonderful hostess and very helpful during my dining experiences.  

ALEXES – Gave helpful details on all the cocktails, which helped me decide what I was in the mood for.

TUPAC – Excellence in customer service, hospitality and guest experience.

MOSH – Excellence in creating unique drinks, and took pride in her service and presentation.

FIFTY MILS – A one-of-a-kind, unique, never seen before cocktail experience that blew me away. The talented mixologists there created a book of fairy tale drinks that were so on-point with their theme and presentation. Creative, delicious, appealing to the eye and the taste was out-of-this-world. From the moment I had my cocktail experiences, it was like I had been transported to a magical place unlike any other cocktail experience I’d ever had. It was so evident to me that every single team member at Fifty Mils worked so hard together as a team to give me an experience that I will never forget. 

THE HOUSEKEEPING TEAM – The housekeeping team was always on time for their two-times-a-day detailed cleaning that they did with pride. 

SELENE Z. – She was an excellent assistant housekeeping manger, who helped me on my last day with extra things that I needed for my room and my packing needs. She stepped up to the plate in a timely manner with eagerness to help and happily took care of all of my requests. She helped make my departure seamless. I appreciated her willingness to help me with so many requests I had at the last minute. 

The lasting impressions that The Four Seasons, Mexico City gave me are wonderful memories that I cherish to this day! My trip exceeded my expectations and makes me think fondly of my trip from beginning to end. My Four Seasons, Mexico City trip was made special because of Tulio H., Octavio M., and all of the team members who work there, and this trip will always hold a special place in my heart because of all of them! I highly recommend this hotel for any time of the year, and you will be glad that you went. I'm so happy that I visited, and I look forward to the next time!",5,2024-10-21T16:02:02Z
152,31,Four Seasons Mexico City,152463.0,"I agree with some of these other reviews that it is more like a 3.5 and not quite up to the standards of other four seasons.  It definitely isn’t worth the price they charge. Lobby and courtyard are gorgeous and the service was great however the halls, rooms and bathrooms feel dated and need a refresh. The gym is also quite small and the pool area needs a refresh.",3,2024-10-18T01:18:09Z

156,32,One&Only Le Saint Geran,256653.0,"You know how you check into a hotel, get your keys and that is it for communication with anyone? Well not at the Pier One.  We arrived after a very long flight and checked in with Jasmine, had a lovely chat, got our keys and went to scope out our room.  The rooms aren’t huge, but we had more than enough space and we looked out over the harbour and bridge. The bed was so comfortable as were the pillows. Went to have a look around The Rocks and Harbour which are all within walking distance. The hotel feels very welcoming when returning, Jasmine asked if all was ok, did we need help etc. so nice they remember who you are. 
We booked the hop on off bus with the concierge. Now usually our experience with a concierge at other hotels has been, average. Not with Eugene. He was amazing. I made an error when booking our tickets and did not find out till we were about to hop on the bus. Went back to Eugene and he had it all sorted with a smile and a “not to worry, it’s all sorted”. No penalty on the tickets, gave us our new voucher and off we went. Every time we needed assistance, Eugene came up with the answers. If only every hotel had a Eugene. Pier One you are very lucky to have this awesome concierge as your employee.

The location is perfect - right in the middle of things.  We had an awesome water view.  The hotel is right by the bridge, with Circular Quay and the Opera House, just a short walk away.  The hotel staff were amazing:  polite, professional and endlessly helpful.  Our room was lovely and very comfortable.  When we returned to Sydney the second time and came back to Pier One, it almost felt like coming home.  And, I can't forget to mention the fantastic breakfast :)",5,2024-10-18T20:33:39Z

160,32,One&Only Le Saint Geran,256653.0,"Despite requesting a quiet room twice during the reservation process we were placed close to the entrance to the bridge on the second floor which serves as a wedding venue. So we had issues getting to and from the room in addition to a lot of noise particularly at the conclusion of the second wedding that night.  Given the rate one pays I don’t think it’s acceptable to place non wedding guests in these rooms. There should be a much greater degree of separation. As such I can’t recommend anyone to stay at this hotel at these times. There are much quieter hotels available in Sydney where function rooms are well away from guest rooms. Sorry Pier One, you can’t have your wedding cake and eat it - ie pack in as many weddings and guests as you can with your current layout.",3,2024-10-05T17:11:01Z

162,33,The Pierre - A Taj Hotel,93603.0,"We booked The Pierre for a special NYC weekend, and MOSTLY, were not disappointed.  However, as a true NYC 5 star icon, I would have expected perfection at $1200/night.  Check in was great, as was our large king room overlooking Central Park.  Great view. Great bed, bathroom, etc.  Second evening, no refreshing of Evian water, no replacement of second water glass.  No rebundling of phone cables.  No replacing used coffee cups. Again, all minor, BUT.  Then at breakfast on the second day, it took almost 40 minutes to get our food and we had train to catch.  Many others, seated before us, got their food (we had standard orders).  And here’s the rub.  After imploring the manager of the dining area to check on our food, we did not hear from him.  Finally our food came, which was quite good, and our server took it off the bill.  BUT, no apology for the delay.  We all make mistakes, though the server was grousing that this happens not infrequently, where the cook just sidelines some orders.  But no apology is simply unacceptable for a 5 star establishment.  Not at $1200/night.",4,2024-11-09T12:22:32Z

They change the linen and towels every day which is a complete waste. Big stains on the carpets outside the elevators on floor 34 and the curtains were worn - time for a brush up I think at this prices. And avoid the very expensive breakfast as even if you buy it in with your room, you have a ceiling they dont tell you about AND you pay tax on top and service for what was not great...",4,2024-10-24T15:15:21Z

In every department we have enjoyed a superb profesional service, but more important... the combination of ""joy"" of service most of the employees transmit. Rare in our times. Sure I will be unfair with some as I do not have all names, and I will congratulate all.

At reception most were great but one Laureano or Salvatore...? was one of a kind.  We stayed 2 weeks and is more than enough time to experience errors and mistakes...was not the case.

The hotel itself is starting to show a bit of its age. Rugs are in need of updating, some curtains look aged. Service is inconsistent. Your coffee may arrive 30 min after your sandwich. Odd policies result in there not being coffee available before 9am unless you get full breakfast. Only 2 coffee capsules per room per day are delivered, and additional ones are charged (!). You need to ask for things because they don’t happen automatically. You will need to call for water, the A/C to be fixed, and for… additional coffee capsules. I’ve been to Faena five or six times.

The hotel itself is of course beautiful and the room we stayed in was gorgeous and very comfortable. The location is very central and you are a stone throw away from everything, you are only yards away from the famous square, this can mean that you can hear quite a lot of noise at night but this is what happens when you stay in a central located hotel. Breakfast was wonderful and perfectly cooked, the buffet selection was also impressive. 

We really had the most wonderful stay. What I will say is, I do think that the rooms should have tea and coffee facilities, I was very surprised that our room did not have this. This is a luxury hotel after all and I feel it’s not something you should have to pay extra for, it is something that is offered at all other hotels so I do think this needs to change, especially for how much you pay to stay here. Bar Magritte is stunning! It really is a beautiful bar, I thought the prices were very steep, I understand this is a very luxurious hotel but I felt like some of the prices were extremely expensive just for the sake of it. I’m from Scotland so I know how much a good whisky costs and Bar Magritte was extremely over priced.

My 20 year old daughter noticed that children were given a stuff squirrel upon arrival.  The front desk team humored our college student and found her a squirrel  that was “hiding.”  

Breakfast was convenient right in the hotel – a good meal despite the higher prices.  The hotel is about 30 minutes from the airport by cab.

We came by Eurostar and arrived in Brussels at 6pm on the day before the wedding and took the 6pm Eurostar back to London the following day so all a bit rushed but thanks in large part to The Amigo hotel ( and to the lovely people we met at the wedding) we managed to relax and thoroughly enjoy ourselves. 
We had interconnecting rooms which were large, well appointed, very clean with very comfortable beds . Both rooms had bathtubs with showers over the bath, the water pressure was fantastic. A big plus for me was that we enjoyed almost complete silence during the night, doubtless due to good soundproofing but also in so many, even five star, hotels we have been kept awake by , I assume residual noise from air conditioning and central heating ducts and pipes but in this case once I turned the aircon off in my room - blissful silence.
We greatly enjoyed our meal in the hotel restaurant , Bocconi,. It is a very attractive space with comfortable seating and attentive staff. We had a very relaxed and enjoyable meal. 
Mainly because our visit was so short and we hadn't visited Brussels before  we really didn't want to risk getting lost or losing precious time looking for taxis etc, we asked the hotel to arrange for a car and driver to collect us from the train station on arrival and again to collect us from the wedding Reception, take us back to the Amigo where the hotel had allowed us to keep one of our rooms at no extra charge so we could change into travel clothes. The car then took us to the Station.

194,40,Four Seasons Beverly Wilshire,125138.0,"This is not a 5 start hotel in terms of quality, amenities, food or services. Location, maybe...  It seems that the hotel is more geared towards a business traveler or hosting a convention, rather than a luxurious experience. Bathroom in our room was in terrible shape - grout missing, mold in corners of the shower, carpet in the room was dirty and looked awful, stains on lamp shade etc. Furnishings were of poor quality and seemed like they will not last long. Four Seasons may have repapered the rooms but did nothing to dated bathrooms which are starting to literally fall apart. Breakfast was just ok, with limited choices and exorbitant prices. We booked through AmEx Fine Hotels and resorts and found out, upon check in, that the offered breakfast for 2 is a mere $90 credit per room. With exorbitant prices ($40 for an egg white frittata) it did't cover much. We ended up going toThe  Peninsula for breakfast - more choices, better quality of food and way less $$, also unbeatable service and courtyard setting. Overall this was a hugely disappointing stay so that we ended up cutting our trip short. It's sad to see such legendary property so mismanaged.",2,2024-10-22T12:34:12Z

We had a One-Bedroom Rodeo View Suite which was wonderful, our room was located on the 8th floor with a great view towards Rodeo Drive. We had breakfast twice and dinner one time in our room, and it was very good and the food was very warm and good. We had dinner at the CUT by Wolfgang Puck, what a pleasure with exellent food and service. We also had one dinner at the BLVD restaurant and we where served a very good dinner there as well.

196,41,Four Seasons Whistler,293175.0,"The Mrs. and I have adopted “luxury travel” as a bit of a hobby (to the degree that we can afford it – we are not multi-millionaires).  One of our primary ways to enable this are trips to Vancouver, B.C., which is only a 3-hour drive from our home (no airfare expense – yaa!).  With that in mind, when we saw an absolute killer Amex Plat FHR daily rate for the Four Seasons Whistler during a period when we needed to be in Vancouver anyway, we jumped all over it.

No regrets…but…some disappointments.

One of the things the Mrs. and I have observed that makes Four Seasons properties special is the experience. It isn’t necessarily about the property itself…the Four Seasons Miami at the time of our visit was essentially brand new; the Four Seasons Singapore is showing its age with both a bit of wear and tear, as well as design themes. It is about the experience, and the majority of that is about the people. The Mrs. and I have speculated that there must be some “Four Seasons University” that staff are sent to, because the service, the hospitality, is always amazing.  They seem to KNOW you are expecting something special, because you could be staying at the Marriott and saving a ton of money. At minimum, if there isn’t a “Four Seasons University”, then surely there is a rigorous hiring process that only the best and most experienced hospitality people could make through. Your first job in hospitality is not going to be at a Four Seasons.

Unless it is the Four Seasons Whistler.

There is a work visa program relationship between the British Commonwealth countries, primarily the U.K., Australia, and Canada, a program that is primarily leveraged by young people in their twenties. I know this because my wife was raised in Australia, and my university age son was raised in Canada. It is a very common thing for Brits to spend a year working in Canada or Australia someplace cool…like Sydney (Bondi Beach) or Canada (Whistler). For Canadians, its London and Sydney. For Aussies, its London and Whistler. The hospitality industry in all three cities leverage this. I’ve seen this in Sydney maybe times. And now I’ve seen it at the Four Seasons Whistler.

Polite, pleasant, enthusiastic, and well-scrubbed is the staff at the Four Seasons Whistler. Bright eyed and bushy tailed. Experienced? Competent? Meh…

The property is lovely – well up to Four Seasons standards (including the Four Seasons level artwork – I am always amazed at how the artwork doesn’t LOOK like “hotel artwork”…I can tell it is good stuff, and I care not a wit about art). Our room? Large and lovely, with in our case a great view. Expectations met.

The people?

I’m different. I know it. Having grown up quite working class and now living at a wee bit of a different station, the “Feeling Special” is a central part of the motivation behind our luxury travel hobby. “Feeling Special” is part of the reward for the hard work that makes $500 - $1000 per night hotel rooms possible it. And the Four Seasons, more than the Fairmont, and as it turns out, more than the Langham, ALWAYS delivers on this. Except when they didn’t at the Four Seasons Whistler. 

Not bad service. Certainly, in no way impolite or improper. And to be clear, the manage level staff – all experienced at other Four Seasons properties (at least the ones I spoke to) were great.

But the Front Desk staff, the wait staff, the bell staff, all the front-line staff, perpetually seemed like they either waiting for me to tell them what to do, or that there was no expectation that they do anything beyond “check the box”. No mindset of “how do I solve this problem” versus “what is the correct answer”.  At a Marriott, you ask about ice, you are told where the ice machine is. At a Four Seasons, the bellman who just dropped your bags either volunteers to get ice or promises to make sure that ice will appear in short order. At a Hilton, you ask for your car, they ask for your ticket, and then ask you what you are driving. At a Four Seasons, they greet you by name and then say “the _____, right?” (Yes, it is true, I don’t drive a Honda or a Toyota, or the like).

Now, given the killer rate we were paying, a rate that included parking and breakfast, I should have NO complaints. But it was a Four Seasons. Except…not quite.",4,2024-11-06T13:48:23Z
197,41,Four Seasons Whistler,293175.0,"Best breakfast buffet we’ve had. Staff A+. Both a  shuttle and car service that can be ordered to get to a particular spot in the Whistler Village. Then, if you walk somewhere , it will pick you up at the new spot. Nice gym. Comfortable bed. We went to Whistler for Thanksgiving dinner with our family, and after reading reviews, decided it was our #1 choice. We had a wonderful suite. Our service dog was with us, and the hotel provided bowls for her food and water, and a very comfy dog bed.

The hotel has a very fun complimentary event daily and we were amazed with its generosity. The first day was a wine tasting, delicious hot chocolate and a sweet treat that was made by by melting a sugary treat and then making it hard by putting it on ice. Kids and adults loved it. 

Valet parking is required.

Everyone loved the outdoor pool, and every room had comfy bathrobes to wear to it.

198,41,Four Seasons Whistler,293175.0,"I stayed at this hotel for a family ski trip, and it's perfectly designed so you don’t need to leave – it has everything and feels especially suited for families. Upon arrival, they welcomed my 2-year-old by taking her to a secret room to pick out a teddy bear. Over the next few days, the nanny took my daughter for more bears, and the staff were always kind, even when she had already taken one. The breakfast buffet is spectacular, and the restaurant is delicious. The Ski Valet service is very convenient since it’s a few minutes’ walk from the hotel to the mountain. They also had hot chocolate and delicious cookies at the Ski Valet, which was a nice treat.

Some downsides are that it’s farther from the village and even from the Blackcomb gondola (compared to the Fairmont). Although there’s a shuttle service to take you to the village, it’s honestly less appealing since it’s so far. Having stayed at the Fairmont before, I’d say the Fairmont has a better pool and spa.

207,43,Four Seasons Prague,275507.0,"While we haven’t stayed at a Four Seasons before, we often stay at luxury hotels on vacation - and this held its own on all counts. (NB: we did not eat in the hotel other than breakfast, nor use the spa/gym). My husband and I stayed for 3 nights.

We booked through Virtuoso, and did receive an upgrade at check-in. Room 405 did not have a view (if we craned our necks, we could see the river), but was a super nice room with two comfy armchairs, a desk, and a very comfortable bed. Some of the pros to us:
- very spacious room with plenty of drawers, countertops, etc. to keep things on
- Housekeeping attention to detail - for example, we liked the Velcro strap they put around our charging cables. And the small gift the first night (facial products) was nice, as was the box of chocolate nuts at check-in.
- So many hotels today require an advanced electrical engineering degree just to get all the lights on and off. This room had one switch, available from the door or next to the bed. Hurrah! There were also some floor and table lamps, each of which had clear and easy to use switches (and worked!). And no nonsense about having to put your keycard in something for the lights to work.
- Similarly, many hotel showers start with burning or freezing you. This one actually had the same simple Hans Grohe controls we have in our own shower at home, so quite familiar to us and it was very straightforward.
- Breakfast buffet was nicely a bit different than what you see at every hotel everywhere, and all the food was quite good. Service slightly spotty - we had to ask three times the first day for my husband’s cappuccino… but then the third morning, the waitress greeted us and immediately said “water, juice, and one cappuccino?”, which was nice.
- There were two different concierges on duty during our stay. They were both helpful with restaurant suggestions and navigation assistance, which was all we required of them. They were very friendly and seemed knowledgeable.
- Fantastic location - really couldn’t be better if you’re planning to see Old Town, Lesser Town, and New Town. Right in the middle so everything was easy to get to.

Cons:
- Not really any! Only one would be the ridiculous amount they wanted to charge for an airport pick-up. Yes, it would have been in a Mercedes-Benz S-class…but that wasn’t worth the €250 they were asking. We booked with a private airport transportation company for €35 instead, and were very happy with it.",5,2024-10-30T20:25:02Z

217,45,Four Seasons Milano,194346.0,"My recent visit to the Four Seasons Hotel in Milan for what was meant to be a serene happy hour with two friends and my beloved Chihuahua turned into a rather startling affair. Nestled into the chic bar area—tables charmingly, if somewhat impractically, close—I couldn’t help but sense discomfort from a couple at the adjacent table. Noting their evident unease with dogs, I respectfully kept my small companion in my arms throughout our stay.

As we prepared to leave, I set my Chihuahua down, and she meandered briefly past their table (the only path available, given the intimate spacing). What happened next was unthinkable: the gentleman kicked my dog.

Stunned and furious, I chose to address the matter with dignity, resisting a direct confrontation. I approached the hotel manager, Simone, and recounted the incident. He assured me of his own fondness for animals and promised to speak with the couple. After his conversation with them, Simone returned with little more than an apologetic shrug and a “there’s nothing we can do.”

It astounds me that such behavior is tolerated in an establishment priding itself on exceptional hospitality. A space that should embody refined civility allowed an act of aggression towards an innocent pet to pass without consequence. This experience left me profoundly disappointed, and I cannot envision returning. Nor can I, in good conscience, recommend the Four Seasons Milan to friends, pet owners, or anyone expecting a standard of decency beyond the mundane.",1,2024-11-02T16:28:37Z

The bad...Lake Terrace bar under-staffed.  Had to finally chase down the lone person serving many tables for a simple digestif.

And the bathroom was simply awful.  Fixtures at par with a Motel 6.  A plastic rotary shower mixer handle?  Impossible to set water temperature in the slippy bathtub.

I arrived at 18:20, seated outside and given the menu. I ordered a glass of wine and some water and then looked at the menu. It was much shorter than the one I had read online when I booked and included things like burgers. I was here for some fine Tuscan dining. I asked the waiter, who was very helpful, if this was the dinner menu and was advised it is the afternoon menu and dinner is served from 19:30. I explained I booked for the a la carte option and there was nothing in their website stating dinner was from 19:30. He said he will see if the kitchen will do it at 19:00 which I would be happy to wait for. Within seconds the ‘supervisor’ came over to me and told me in no uncertain terms that dinner is from 19:30 and that’s it. He couldn’t have been more stern and rude. When the initial waiter came back I said I will have the wine and go somewhere else for dinner. He was most apologetic and brought me some small bites by way of an apology which I appreciated. Albeit they were very bland. When I finished the wine at about 18:50 I asked another waiter for the bill. It arrived and they were charging me €9 for the water which I hadn’t touched as I had ordered it to go with dinner. I told him I wasn’t paying for the water. He changed the bill and then as I paid I said to him it was a terrible experience and he again repeated we only serve dinner from 19:30 and you were given the menu for lunch so there is no problem.

What was supposed to be a 20-minute one-time stop turned into our favorite spot in all of Florence, and one we returned to four separate times on our trip.

Everyone who has spent even a few minutes at a Rocco Forte hotel (like the Savoy) knows the service is impeccable. And the service at Irene is no exception. Despite not being guests of the hotel we were treated with absolute friendliness, professionalism, and made to feel like we were VIPs. 

We visited twice for drinks and snacks, once for breakfast and once for lunch, and every time the service was exactly the same - outstanding. 

We would like to particularly thank Glulia and Andrea - two staff members we saw multiple times who both went out of their way to make us feel special and to accommodate any request we had. 

Now to the food and drinks... almost as good as the service! We had glasses of prosecco, and various drinks from their extensive cocktail menu, and everything was as good or better than anything we had in all of Italy. Thanks to Irene I have a new favorite cocktail; the GIN SMASH. Try it if you go there, and tell Andrea that Paul recommended it!! 

For food, we had the club sandwich - which is said to be the best in Florence. Well, it is. And having tried the clubs at both the St. Regis and the Westin, I will tell you that Irene's IS the best! We also had amazing pastas, salads that were fresh and crisp, and desserts that rivaled the best pastry shops in the country.

Positives:
 - Beautiful and large rooms with sufficient closets and large bathroom with bath and walk-in shower
 - Relatively quiet, the only noise we heard from outside was that of sirens 
 - Friendly staff
 - Walkable to many of the must-see tourist attractions.  Pike Place is just a short walk, and the metro and monorail are not too far away.

252,52,InterContinental Willard,84131.0,"I currently stay at the Willard for five days (leaving the day after tomorrow), and unfortunately, my experience so far is extremely disappointing. On the first day, I was greeted with unsightly stains in the middle of both bedspreads (pictures attached). Although the reception quickly changed the linens and offered a restaurant credit, this was just the beginning of a series of unacceptable issues.

That evening, I found that the water in the bathroom was not hot. The sink water was barely lukewarm, and the shower was only slightly warmer, making it unsuitable for a bath. I reported this to the reception the next morning, and they assured me they would address it. However, when I returned after 10 hours, I found a mere drink voucher and a note claiming a technician had been informed, yet the water temperature was still unchanged.

Frustrated, I contacted the reception again, and they sent a technician who spent 20 minutes in the bathroom, measuring the water temperature at 92 degrees Fahrenheit (picture attached). He argued that this was sufficiently hot, all while wearing shoes in the bathroom and bathtub (which was not cleaned thereafter). He promised to replace the fixtures the next day, but when I returned, nothing had been done. The water remained as cold as on the first night.

The hotel did not offer a room change, which is unacceptable for such an expensive establishment. Despite multiple complaints about the cold water, the only response was a voucher for a complimentary drink at the bar. It seems the hotel expects me to endure five days with lukewarm water, which is far from the service one would expect at this price point. 

Looking at the other reviews, I don't seem to be the first to have problems with cold water. However, it seems that no appropriate solution has been found for this problem or even how to deal with the affected guests.",1,2024-10-28T23:10:49Z

First off, you can't order the burger unless you are dining in the bar.  Second, we waited an hour for any morsel of food.  Meanwhile we saw neighboring tables who arrived after us receiving popovers, fries and even first courses.  By the time we finally received our trio of fries, they were not even hot.
We enjoyed the tomato tart and the salad.  The oysters were not special and were quite expensive.  My date did not care for his steak - too charred on the outside and burnt tasting.  My lamb shops were ok, but undercooked.  We were intrigued by the idea of dessert, but just did not want to wait any longer. Our server was impossible to hail down!

All in all a fine hotel in a great location.",5,2024-11-10T12:51:53Z
272,56,Four Seasons Boston,89585.0,"First time in Boston, First time in USA and first holiday abroad in a long, long time, we wanted to go all out luxury.  An 11th hour chat with a colleague who advised us to stay in the Back Bay Area saw me change hotels to the Four Seasons.  The location is perfect, directly across from the Boston Public Gardens and our room choice reflected this.  The hotel is best described as a big modern box with the rooms smaller boxes within it.  I’ll be honest, reading the hype about Four Seasons, I was expecting old school grandeur in the entrance and the public areas but there was none.  Arriving, you go from the car drop off through a set of doors into the foyer and are met straight ahead by the reception desks. It’s a modern, stand up check in.  I honestly felt that we’d entered the back door of the hotel!  We’ve stayed in some lovely, five star and deluxe hotels in the past and my expectations for this standard of entrance and foyer were not met.  (The hotel has a distinct lack of public space, there are one or two seats in the foyer but no large lounge area.  A coffee shop and small restaurant/bistro are on the ground floor. The hotel and the room were immaculately clean.   We went with a front facing Deluxe Garden View Room with One king bed. The view was lovely, as we went in October the colours of the trees across the street were beautiful.  Room itself was not huge, but comfortable with a nice table and chairs at the window.  The bathroom was small but well appointed with a shower and bath.  Staff could not have been nicer and more accommodating, allowing us an earlier check in and late check out plus giving us access to the hotel amenities until we left at 5pm.  This included an internal courtyard which we viewed but looked a bit windy so we didn’t go in. As we only had two days and a night in Boston we wanted to explore the city so didn’t spend much time in the hotel and never got to see the pool. 
We had in room dining on arrival for a late lunch which was very nice in the form of a club sandwich to share.  
On the Saturday morning I joined executive chef Patrice Martineau for the “Run Club” a fantastic experience seeing beautiful parts of the city on a run which is free for guests. One of the most memorable experiences of any hotel stay.  Sadly we didn’t get a chance to experience the Chef’s team’s amazing breakfast as there was a 30 minute wait when we arrived at the restaurant, which surprised us for a hotel of this standard, we’d never been asked to wait for breakfast before. The restaurant manager insisted he could get us in, but the moment had passed and we decided to grab something externally and explore Boston. This led to a very accommodating reduction in our bill which was extremely nice of all concerned. We were extremely grateful for the kindness and level of service by all staff, the location was perfect to explore the city and the hotel is immaculate. In summary, comparing with other luxury hotels we’ve been in, we had higher expectations. We felt it was overpriced for a box in a box room, a disappointing 30 minute wait for breakfast and a lack of public areas to sit and relax, however the staff and location could not be surpassed.  Would we stay there again? Yes… if there was a deal on the room rate… but we would look at other nearby options.",4,2024-11-03T00:41:30Z

It’s imperative that this hotel be shut down and renovated immediately or sold to new owners. It’s an insult to the Four Seasons brand, which has already declined due to their refusal to refresh their properties and their inability to compete with newer brands like Edition, Public, Six Senses, Aman, and so on.

The property is extremely outdated and feels gross. The service is terrible; it took 30 minutes to get a toothbrush kit, and I even requested a new hairdryer because the one in the room was broken, likely old, and never received it. And the food? Inedible! Avoid the rib eye quesadilla at all costs; it’s filled with some strange stew. I’ll never be staying here again.

Excellent service, very kind team. Good food too. Not typical hotel food. 

Most helpful and resourceful Concierge and hands on Hotel Manager.

I would only say that the rooms would benefit from some refreshment and renovations as the age seems to taking its toll on the facilities... Bathrooms can be made bigger, gym / pool area also very good - not nearly as good as in Moscow or Dubai or Hong Kong.",5,2024-11-09T09:09:30Z

284,58,Four Seasons Palm Beach,85517.0,"I recently traveled with my wife and infant to the Four Seasons Palm Beach in mid-September for three nights, and we had a wonderful time. It was our second visit to the property, after a very positive stay three years ago on a family trip with all adults. We had been looking for a chance to come back, and it turned out to be perfect for us now with a baby in tow. We could not have received warmer and more attentive service, and we just love how this property exudes a laid-back retro beach vibe that is comfortable, but luxurious enough to be a Four Seasons. 

Trip Planning/Pre-Arrival:

As we always do when booking a Four Seasons, we made sure to book through a Preferred Partner travel agent, which enabled us to get free perks (I highly recommend doing this). For no extra cost, our reservation included early check-in and a room upgrade based on availability, a one-time $100 resort credit, and a breakfast credit each morning of $110, which could be used in the restaurant or for in-room dining. We appreciated that the breakfast credit was actually enough to cover breakfast for two, which is not the case at all Four Seasons properties. We had booked the most basic Palm View Room, and also appreciated that our travel agent was able to confirm an upgrade to a Resort View Room prior to arrival with the hotel, even though the upgrade is usually not given until check-in.

Prior to our stay, I contacted the hotel with questions through the Four Seasons app, and they always responded within minutes. They sent me a variety of helpful pre-arrival information, including a local guide to popular restaurants, as well as the daily activity schedule at the hotel. I was really impressed at how nicely presented and organized the recommendations were. It was also nice that when I asked some follow-up questions related to traveling with an infant, the staff was easily able to customize the recommendations further.

The only slight negative was that while the staff would always respond to my initial messages very quickly, the follow-through to complete the request was sometimes missed. For example, a request to make a dining reservation was acknowledged, but only completed when I followed up over a day later and it was clear it had been forgotten. A similar thing happened again when we asked for information about cabana rentals. I received a response saying information would come shortly, but never received anything.
	
There was then a third communication miss during our stay. We had made a request on the app at one point to have an in-room dining plate removed from our room, and were told someone would be right up. Six hours later, it was still there. While the staff is great, and these were minor misses, a little more attention to the chat messages would be helpful to ensure the app works as intended.

Arrival:
Our arrival experience at the hotel was very positive. We were helped promptly by a bellman and directed to the front desk, where the clerk who checked us in was friendly and professional. She immediately offered us glasses of sparkling wine, along with a welcome back to the hotel and acknowledgement that they were looking forward to making sure we had an even better stay than last time, when we had some minor suggestions for improvement. As part of the hotel’s efforts to make sure we had a great return stay, we really appreciated the news that our room had been upgraded several categories beyond what we expected, to an Ocean View Studio Suite, and that it was ready early around noon. Justin, the hotel’s front desk manager, also greeted us upon arrival, as did another member of the management team. We really loved the warm welcome and the strong effort to make sure we were recognized as repeat guests.
Room:

For a little bit of context on the room types and hotel layout, the hotel is an unassuming set of three nondescript white concrete buildings (North, Main, and South), which are each four stories tall and arranged in a U-shape facing the pools and beach. Although the hotel has been a Four Seasons for a long time, it wasn’t originally built as one, and the look of the buildings reflects that. However, the entire interior is great, with a pink and green botanical and beachy feel that carries between common areas and the rooms, which pairs well with the lush exterior. All portions of the hotel are connected by interior corridors on the ground level, and it is relatively compact, which we love. No matter where your room is, it’s not far to any hotel amenity, and it’s just spread out enough to not feel crowded. 

All of the standard guest rooms are split between the North and South buildings, which are positioned perpendicular to the ocean, so the rooms have angled balconies. The difference between the standard room types is really just view/location, as they are all identical in size at 393 square feet, which definitely felt small during our last stay.

The best building is the Main Building, which I believe only contains suites, and was where we stayed this time. The location is ideal, with rooms right above the lobby, and easy access to the pools and restaurant. The views are also the best, since you’re looking straight at the pools and ocean. 

We really enjoyed the Ocean View Studio Suite, and I would love to have one again in the future. While the title of “suite” for this room type feels like a little bit of a stretch, since it was basically just a large hotel room, it was certainly a step up from the small standard rooms. Especially with a baby and all of her gear, we really appreciated the extra space, since the room had a king bed, plus a large sitting area with a pull-out couch and extra armchair. The covered balcony was also nicely sized with a table and two chairs.

The bathroom was nice as well, and was spacious as compared to those in the standard rooms (again, like the rest of the room, the suite bathroom would probably seem standard sized at many hotels, but was noticeably an upgrade here). The bathroom was nicely appointed in marble, with a spacious walk-in shower and large vanity with two sinks. We like the geranium and mandarin-scented bath products at this hotel, which fit the destination well. The bathroom was well stocked in general, including plenty of thick towels and robes.

The minibar features an espresso machine and tea kettle, along with snacks and a stocked fridge. You can’t use the fridge to store your own things, since it was the type where you are automatically charged if a sensor notices that you move any of the minibar items. However, when we requested a separate fridge for our own use with the baby, they sent one up right away, which was large.

I was also glad to see that this hotel continues to evolve and takes guest feedback into account. During our last stay, one of my complaints was that there was no beach bag offered in the room, but the rooms now offer them for guests to use during their stay.

We were also very impressed with how well-equipped the room was for traveling with a baby. Prior to our arrival, we had requested any baby items the hotel could provide, and there were many of them, ready to go when we arrived in our room. In addition to some cute baby gifts, including two stuffed animals, the room was stocked with an Ubbi diaper pail, hooded baby towel, diapers, sound machine, baby tub, and baby shampoo and lotion. They also included a full crib. We also needed distilled water to make bottles, and the hotel was happy to provide a full gallon for us so that we didn’t have to go out to buy it. The breadth of items offered was incredibly appreciated and helpful.

In addition to enjoying the amount of space and amenities, I thought the room was in good condition, although there is starting to be just slight wear and tear to the some of the furniture and fabrics that will need a little bit of a refresh in the coming years.

The hotel also provided daily amenities that we really enjoyed. Shortly after check-in, handwritten notes welcoming both us and our daughter individually to the hotel were delivered, along with bottled water, a bowl of fresh fruit, and some small desserts. The next day, we received a plate of chocolates, and then on our last night, a cheese and charcuterie plate. We know this is above and beyond what we’d normally receive, even at a Four Seasons, but really appreciated the staff’s commitment to making sure our return visit this time was perfect.

Housekeeping did a good job, and our room was always very clean. We would typically request cleaning at the time that worked best for us each day, and it was always completed when requested. Turndown was a little more of a mixed bag. While the turndown service itself was fine, the timing of it wasn’t ideal, and it was always done very early. One night, the housekeeper came for turndown at a time that wasn’t convenient, so we asked if she could come back a bit later while we’d be at dinner. She responded by saying she’d see if she could make it work, since she planned to be in the other building later. She did return, but still earlier than we had requested, so we had to ask again for her to come back. I didn’t like feeling pressured about it, and we weren’t asking for it to be done at an unreasonably late time. We were also disappointed on another night to come back from the pool shortly after 5:00 pm to find turndown already completed. That’s simply too early, and we much prefer to have time to shower after being at the pool or beach, and then have turndown while we’re at dinner, so that we can get towels replenished for the next morning.

Beach & Pool:

The beach and pools at the Four Seasons Palm Beach are lovely, and were a major motivation for returning to this hotel in the first place. The pool deck itself is very spacious, with more than enough lounge chairs and space for everyone, set up in various locations facing the pools or toward the ocean. The two pools offered are a main family pool, and then a separate smaller adults-only pool on its own to one side, separated by a wall of landscaping. Both pools are truly just steps away from the beach itself, which is perfect for easily going between the beach and pools or back to your room. The beach itself is also very nice, with typically placid waters, soft sand, and rows of chairs set up each morning facing the ocean. The staff even set up fun displays in the sand with toys for kids each day as well.

There are also a few cabanas in prime spots by each pool that can be rented, in addition to sun beds on the beach. We ended up deciding to book a cabana by the family pool one day, and it was easy to reserve using a QR code in our room that listed hotel activities. We really loved having the private space and personalized attention and service that came with it. The cabana we rented was $250 for the day, and included two glasses of any wine on the pool menu, a fruit plate, and unlimited still and sparkling water, tea, and soda. Given what was included and how nice the space was, we found the cost to be relatively reasonable. 

The beach and pool had impeccable service, with personal attention from friendly and enthusiastic staff members. It was not very crowded a couple of the days we were there mid-week in September, and the staff was just always present, kind, and ready to be helpful, which we loved. They did a great job of checking in on us very often, sometimes even with just a quick wave or thumbs up to make sure we were ok, which provided a perfect level of attentiveness without being too intrusive. The staff would also leave a button to press anytime we wanted service, which usually wasn’t necessary since they were around so much. However, the couple times we did press the button, we were being served truly within seconds. 

There were also frequent little extras passed to guests at the beach and pool, which are always really nice at luxury hotels, including fresh fruit, mini smoothies, and even mini mimosas one time. Our favorite pool amenity was the gelato cart that was offered for an hour each afternoon by the family pool, with several flavors and toppings to choose from.

It was clear to me that the high level of service was not just because the hotel was pretty empty (although it certainly helps), as even on a busy Saturday when we first arrived, service from Gwen at the beach was top notch, and we really appreciated how helpful Michael and the other beach staff members were with setting up umbrellas, adjusting them with the sun and wind, and making guests aware of the ocean conditions and possible hazards. 

Other Hotel Activities: 

Outside of spending time at the beach and pool, I would highly recommend taking advantage of some of the daily hotel activities that are included as part of the $45 per night resort fee. In our room, there was a QR code that only works on the hotel wifi network, which took us to a website listing the various classes offered each day. The only health and wellness class offered was beach yoga (more general fitness classes would be nice), and then there were a variety of food and beverage options, with something different offered each day (mixology, cooking school, a chocolate class). There are only a few spots in each class, so it’s worth signing up early in your stay for any you may be interested in.

The only class that worked with our schedule this time was a mixology class at Seaway, the outdoor restaurant by the pool. It was a quick, but enjoyable experience, and the bartender who conducted it was very nice. He had a station set up for each participant to mix the various ingredients to create one of the cocktails on the pool/beach menu, and then we got to take that cocktail with us back to the pool.

Otherwise, the resort fee includes complimentary bikes available to rent, as well as use of a house car that can go within a six-mile radius. We didn’t use the house car, and it seems to be of limited utility, since the main areas for shopping and dining in Palm Beach that everyone would typically want to visit are further than six miles away.

The hotel also has tennis courts (with lessons available for a fee), a gym, and a spa for additional activities.

Dining: 

Florie’s is the main hotel restaurant, which overlooks the pool from pretty interior and exterior seating areas. We had breakfast there two mornings, and had a pleasant experience each time. The service was always attentive and friendly, and the food was pretty good. However, we thought Florie’s really stood out more in the evening. We went there for dinner on our first night and had a really wonderful meal. The tuna tartare and local burrata were great starters, along with the delicious complimentary warm bread that is provided. We also had a truffle pasta special and the salt-crusted dorade that was fileted tableside, and both were really excellent. 

We enjoyed our dinner at Florie’s so much that we even cancelled a dinner reservation at an outside restaurant another night because we enjoyed staying at the hotel to dine so much, which is really rare for us when traveling. We ultimately returned to the Florie’s lounge area on each of the next two nights for lighter meals and drinks, as well as another time during their daily happy hour for discounted oysters and drinks.

The Florie’s bar/lounge area is especially pretty and comfortable, like being in a cozy living room. Our visits there were made even better by the server Christian. He was absolutely wonderful, and provided excellent service. He remembered us each day, was always attentive, and exhibited a truly caring, kind nature. On one occasion when our daughter started melting down toward the end of our visit, Christian showed such care and concern for her, and without having to ask, went ahead and prepared a tray of our food and drinks, plus some small dessert items, to take back up to the room. He anticipated our needs so well in that situation, and seeing him each night was a highlight of our time at the hotel. He is a huge asset to the team.

The other main dining option at the hotel is Seaway, an outdoor restaurant overlooking the beach that is only open for lunch. It would be nice if it had dinner service as well, since it has great views, and it would be nice to have a second dinner option. The menu at Seaway is what is offered at the pool and beach as well. We enjoyed lunch at Seaway on our arrival day, plus food and drinks on multiple occasions at the pool and beach. We’re big fans of their chirashi bowl and mahi tacos in particular. Their bartenders also make great cocktails, with the Endless Summer (basically a spicy margarita with mezcal) being our favorite.

We did choose in-room dining on one occasion for breakfast, and it was a positive experience. The food arrived in exactly the time frame quoted on the phone when I ordered, and the staff member set it up nicely for us on our balcony. Food quality was identical to dining in the restaurant.

Location:

Although the Four Seasons is located in Palm Beach, it’s at the quiet, south end of Palm Beach, a good 15-minute drive from the main shopping and dining areas. If you plan to go into the thick of Palm Beach often, it might be helpful to have a car. We don’t mind the location at all, since we like the peace and quiet that the Four Seasons affords, but I could see others being unhappy if you were hoping to be in the most central location possible. Somewhere like The Breakers would be a better choice if a more central location is what you’re looking for, although that property is much larger than the intimate Four Seasons. 

We do love how convenient it is to fly into West Palm Beach (PBI) for a stay here, which is an easy 15-minute drive from the hotel.  

Staff Service:

When staying at a beach resort where we’re going to spend most of our time on property, service is really key, and this hotel was perfect. We felt recognized and valued as guests throughout our visit. It helped that it wasn’t busy during most of our stay, so the staff/guest ratio was high, but we were also there on one busier day, and the service level was the same. Everyone was friendly and approachable, and it felt genuine. It truly feels like the team at this hotel takes pride in their jobs and wants to make sure guests have a great experience. I’m often frustrated with service at luxury hotels just not being quite good enough, but I would point to the Four Seasons Palm Beach as the template others should follow. 

The personalized nature of the service was noted and appreciated. For example, Justin, the Front Desk Manager, was so nice, and went out of his way to find us and check-in on us every single day of our stay, which we loved. He remembered what we were doing and asked about it afterward, and it really helped to know we had someone we could go to if we needed anything at all.

Separately, when we mentioned that our dog, who often travels to Four Seasons hotels with us and had been at this hotel previously, couldn’t make it this time, the hotel sent up a handwritten note for her, along with a flamingo dog toy and dog treats we could take home. This personalized touch meant so much to us.

The only place where service could be considered at all poor was at the hotel boutique, Swell. We went in there very briefly to look around and found the staff member to be rude, which was interesting, since we had the same complaint about Swell during our stay three years ago. However, that was truly so minor and in no way overshadows the near perfection that is the service at this hotel otherwise.

Overall:

We love the Four Seasons Palm Beach, and were so glad we chose this for a weekend getaway. The property is lovely and easy to navigate, with excellent staff and facilities. It was a perfect stay with a baby, and we look forward to returning as a family in the future. After stays at many Four Seasons properties, we have concluded that this is one of our favorites.",5,2024-09-29T16:05:54Z

289,59,Capri Palace Jumeirah,228964.0,"We are huge fans of Capri but have never stayed in Anacapri before.  We wanted to give it a try and selected Capri Palace due the many things it has to offer.  

This is truly a full service hotel. The amenities , eateries and staff are absolutely 5 star. Unfortunately, the rooms are not. I don’t want that comment to take away from how amazing and hard working the staff is but I do think management should think about the many necessary upgrades needed to the rooms. 

Outside of that, we very much enjoyed our stay.  Having Zuma on-site on the rooftop is wonderful.  The food and views there are outstanding and it is a very lively and fun vibe. Bar degli Artisti was also amazing.  The performers Miriam and Aziz were incredible and made for such a fun time.  We would seriously arrange our dinners around trying to see them perform. They are also such warm and genuine people. 

The shining star of Capri Palace is by far Il Riccio. The coveted position of this restaurant and beach club just next to the blue grotto is absolutely stunning but what truly makes this place is the staff!!!  Roberto who runs Il Riccio is the absolute best. This restaurant is obviously a well known establishment but Roberto’s warmth and welcoming demeanor spills down to his staff which makes dining and spending the day here an unforgettable experience. Lifeguards and beach club staff, Mona and Pasquale, are extremely attentive and pleasure to share the beautiful setting alongside.

296,61,One&Only Palmilla,256653.0,"You know how you check into a hotel, get your keys and that is it for communication with anyone? Well not at the Pier One.  We arrived after a very long flight and checked in with Jasmine, had a lovely chat, got our keys and went to scope out our room.  The rooms aren’t huge, but we had more than enough space and we looked out over the harbour and bridge. The bed was so comfortable as were the pillows. Went to have a look around The Rocks and Harbour which are all within walking distance. The hotel feels very welcoming when returning, Jasmine asked if all was ok, did we need help etc. so nice they remember who you are. 
We booked the hop on off bus with the concierge. Now usually our experience with a concierge at other hotels has been, average. Not with Eugene. He was amazing. I made an error when booking our tickets and did not find out till we were about to hop on the bus. Went back to Eugene and he had it all sorted with a smile and a “not to worry, it’s all sorted”. No penalty on the tickets, gave us our new voucher and off we went. Every time we needed assistance, Eugene came up with the answers. If only every hotel had a Eugene.
